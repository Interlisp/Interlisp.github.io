(Deprecated) If defined, shapefile specifies a file containing user-supplied node content.
The <A HREF=#d:shape><B>shape</B></A> of the node is set to box.
The image in the shapefile must be
rectangular. The image formats supported as well as the precise semantics of
how the file is used depends on the
<A HREF="output.html">output format</A>.  For further details, see
<A HREF=output.html#d:image_fmts>Image Formats</A> and
<A HREF="../../../faq/#ext_image">External PostScript files</A>.
<P>
There is one exception to this usage.
If <B>shape</B> is set to "epsf", shapefile gives
a filename containing a definition of the node in PostScript.
The graphics defined must be contain all of the
node content, including any desired boundaries.
For further details, see
<A HREF="../../../faq/#ext_ps_file">
External PostScript files</A>.
