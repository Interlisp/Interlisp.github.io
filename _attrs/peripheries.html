Set number of peripheries used in polygonal shapes and cluster
boundaries. Note that
<A HREF=shapes.html#epsf>user-defined shapes</A> are treated as a
form of box shape, so the default
peripheries value is 1 and the user-defined shape will be drawn in
a bounding rectangle. Setting <TT>peripheries=0</TT> will turn this off.
Also, 1 is the maximum peripheries value for clusters.
