Controls how, and if, edges are represented. If true, edges are drawn as
splines routed around nodes; if false, edges are drawn as line segments.
If set to <tt>none</tt> or "", no edges are drawn at all.
<P>
(1 March 2007) The values <TT>line</TT> and <TT>spline</TT> can be
used as synonyms for <TT>false</TT> and <TT>true</TT>, respectively.
In addition, the value <TT>polyline</TT> specifies that edges should be
drawn as polylines.
<P>
(28 Sep 2010) The value <TT>ortho</TT> specifies edges should be
routed as polylines of axis-aligned segments. Currently, the routing
does not handle ports or, in dot, edge labels.
<P>
(25 Sep 2012) The value <TT>curved</TT> specifies edges should be
drawn as curved arcs.

<P>
By default, the attribute is unset. How this is interpreted depends on
the layout. For dot, the default is to draw edges as splines. For all
other layouts, the default is to draw edges as line segments. Note that
for these latter layouts, if <TT>splines="true"</TT>, this
requires non-overlapping nodes (cf. <A HREF=#d:overlap><B>overlap</B></A>).
If fdp is used for layout and <TT>splines="compound"</TT>, then the edges are
drawn to avoid clusters as well as nodes.
