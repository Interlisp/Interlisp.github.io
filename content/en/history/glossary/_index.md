The names “Medley,” "Interlisp-D," “Interlisp.org,” “Common Lisp,” etc. are often used in confusing ways. We’re talking about a lot of different things that evolved over decades. These are cemented in by usage in different publications over time. We hope this glossary of terms will help.

## Vocabulary and relationships

AltoLisp
:  An (unsuccessful) attempt to build a Lisp-based OS for running Interlisp on an Alto.

Carol, Fugue, Harmony, Intermezzo, Koto, Lyric, Medley
: Named releases of Interlisp-D.  All are obsolete except Medley.

Common Lisp
: The subject of a 10-year standards process to converge multiple dialects of the
Lisp language. Strong influences from many Lisp dialects, including Interlisp.

Common Lisp the Language
: Book by Guy Steele with two editions:

- CLtL1 – edition 1, 465 pages
- CLtL2  – second edition, 1029 pages

Common Lisp dpANS
: The ANSI Standard for Common Lisp.

Starting with the Lyric release of Interlisp-D and then the Medley release, the implementation of Medley included implementations of Common Lisp (CLtL 1) as well as the Interlisp dialect in a single development environment; this was made possible by using the (Common Lisp) “package” feature to allow both dialects to be intermixed.

Dfasl
: A compiled form of Medley Interlisp files with the extension ".dfasl".

DLISP
: By Warren Teitelman: a first attempt at building a “Display” (GUI) with Interlisp running on MAXC (a PDP-10 clone) connected by Ethernet to a Xerox Alto acting 
as a graphics terminal.

Dorado Lisp
: The reimplementation of the AltoLisp microcode on the Dorado – a research prototype.

Fugue
: An obsolete named release of Interlisp-D.

Harmony
: An obsolete named release of Interlisp-D.

Intermezzo
: An obsolete named release of Interlisp-D.

Interlisp
: A GitHub “organization” with ~20 repositories, see <https://github.com/Interlisp>
: Both a language and, in some cases, the implementation of that language. Usually used with some other wording or refinement.

Interlisp: The Language and its usage
: A book by Steve Kaisler which describes Interlisp of the 1970s & 80s.

Interlisp.org
: The project's Internet domain name, used for its websites and email addresses.

- <https://interlisp.org>  – the address of the main web site
- <https://online.interlisp.org> – the address of a service that lets you run Medley
- <info@interlisp.org>             - the project's general information email address

Interlisp-10
: The first implementation of Interlisp for the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-10 / Tenex.

Interlisp-360
: Implemention of Interlisp for the IBM-360.

Interlisp-D
: What Dorado Lisp became.  The D stood for both “Display” and “D-machine”.  An implementation of

- Interlisp the language
- The Interlisp programming tools
- A Graphical User interface to Interlisp programming development
- A large number of tools, utilities, games, screen-savers
- A Lisp-based operating system for D-machines which, when coupled with microcode
  implementation of a Virtual Machine, allowed the D-machines to operate as a
  personal workstation. Each D-machine had its own microcode with different
  configurations and micro-instructions.

Interlisp-VAX
: Implementation of Interlisp for Digital Equipment Corporation VAX systems.

Koto
: An obsolete named release of Interlisp-D.

Lcom
: Used as a file ending, xxx.lcom, for compiled Medley files.

Lyric
: An obsolete named release of Interlisp-D.

Medley
: The final named release of Interlisp-D.  

Medley 1.0, Medley 2.01, Medley 3.5 numbered releases of Interlisp-D
: At some point the name Interlisp-D was retired and Medley used to name the software.

Maiko
: An implementation of the functions of the D-machine microcode, but written in C for the
      Sun Microsystems SPARC processor workstation, initially developed by
       Fuji Xerox.  Subsequently ported to little-endian processors and other operating systems.

SDL
: Structured Design Language.

Sysout
: A file containing the saved state of Interlisp virtual memory.

X11
: The X Window System.

### Organizations

BBN
: [Bolt, Beranek, and Newman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raytheon_BBN), a Cambridge, Mass. consulting firm which sponsored the
      creation of BBN Lisp, Interlisp's immediate ancestor, as well as the Tenex operating system.

Xerox PARC or just PARC
: Palo Alto Research Center, which continued in collaboration with BBN on (renamed) Interlisp. PARC developed the Alto and Dorado.  Now part of SRI International.

SRI International
: A non-profit scientific R & D institute, headquertered in Menlo Park, California.

Xerox Electro-Optical Systems (XEOS)
: A former Xerox division supporting government customers.

Xerox Artificial Intelligence Systems (XAIS)
: The former Xerox division working to commercialize Xerox workstations running Interlisp-D.

Rank Xerox
: Xerox's European subsidiary, a joint venture of Xerox Corp. and the Rank Organization, which sold Interlisp-D workstations in Europe.

Fuji Xerox
: Xerox's Japanese subsidiary, owned jointly by Rank Xerox and Fujifilm Corp., responsible for selling and supporting Interlisp-D systems in Japan.

Envos
: Company founded in 198x to take on the Lisp business from Xerox. Closed within 10 months and folded back into Xerox.

Venue
: Company founded by John Sybalsky, former Xerox and Envos employee, which obtained a license to create and distribute derivative works of Maiko and Medley.

Medley Interlisp Project
: Began late 2010’s with Nick Briggs getting Maiko to run on macOS.  The group expanded and began holding weekly online meetings in 2020.
