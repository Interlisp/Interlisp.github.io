<P>
The viewPort <TT>W,H,Z,x,y</TT> or <TT>W,H,Z,N</TT>
specifies a viewport for the final image. The pair (W,H) gives the
dimensions (width and height) of the final image, in
<A HREF=#points>points</A>.
The optional Z is the zoom factor, i.e., the image in the original layout will be
W/Z by H/Z points in size. By default, Z is 1.
The optional last part is either a pair (x,y) giving a position in the original layout of the
graph, in
<A HREF=#points>points</A>, of the center of the viewport, or the name N
of a node whose center should used as the focus.
By default, the focus is the center of the graph bounding box, i.e.,
(bbx/2,bby/2), where "bbx,bby" is the
value of the bounding box attribute <A HREF=#a:bb>bb</A>.
<P>
Sample values: <TT>50,50,.5,'2.8 BSD'</TT> or <TT>100,100,2,450,300</TT>.
The first will take the 100x100 point square centered on the node <TT>2.8 BSD</TT>
and scale it down by 0.5, yielding a 50x50 point final image.
