<BLOCKQUOTE>
The <tt>fdp</tt> layout program supports edges between nodes and clusters
and cluster-to-cluster.  The syntax is fairly obvious.  
<tt>fdp</tt> is being actively worked on, so the probability of hitting a
bug is higher than with neato. Also the quality of the layouts will
be improving.
