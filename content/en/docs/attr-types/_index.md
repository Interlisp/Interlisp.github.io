Catalogue of the schemas/types/grammars expected by [attributes]({{< ref "../attrs/_index.md" >}}).

The following list gives the legal strings corresponding to values of
the given types.
The syntax for describing legal type strings is a mixture of literal strings,
stdio encodings (e.g., `%f` for a double), and regular expressions.
For regular expressions, `(...)*` indicates 0 or more copies of the expression
enclosed in the parentheses,  `(...)+` indicates 1 or more, and
`(...)?` denotes 0 or 1 copy.
