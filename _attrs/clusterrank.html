Mode used for handling clusters. If <B>clusterrank</B> is "local", a
subgraph whose name begins with "cluster" is given special treatment.
The subgraph is laid out separately, and then integrated as a unit into
its parent graph, with a bounding rectangle drawn about it.
If the cluster has a <A HREF=#d:label>label</A> parameter, this label
is displayed within the rectangle.
Note also that there can be clusters within clusters.
At present, the modes "global" and "none"
appear to be identical, both turning off the special cluster processing.
