We owe the existence of Medley Interlisp to over one hundred contributors. These include people working at Xerox, other companies, university students and staff, as well as software enthusiasts from around the world. We don't have the means to find and credit them all so the listing here is by no means complete. With that said, these are some of the people who have helped make the Medley Interlisp project what it is:

### Medley Revival Inaugural Team

Larry Masinter, Rob Kaplan, Nick Briggs, Frank Halasz, Herb Jellinek, Steve Kaisler, Wayne Marci, Paul McJones, Bruce Mitchener, John Cowan, Arun Welch, Michele Denber, Blake McBride, Abe Jellinek, Bill Stumbo

### Newcomers to the Team

Matt Heffron, Eric Kaltman, Paolo Amoroso
