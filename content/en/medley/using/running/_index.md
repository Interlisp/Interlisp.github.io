You can run Medley Interlisp on a wide variety of systems.  This section lays out the basics to help you choose:

* [Interlisp Online](/medley/using/running/online)
  * for most systems; see caveats
* Download and install from a release
  * [Running on Mac](/medley/using/running/running-on-mac)
  (Is this active or still in progress? If it is not ready, I do not think we should not have it listed.)
  * [Running on Windows](/medley/using/running/running-on-win)
    * For Windows 10 or 11 with WSL1 or WSL2
  * [Running on Linux](/medley/using/running/running-on-linux)

For other OS or machine architectures, You can (re)build the virtual machine emulator (Maiko) from sources, and then run in a release or even build your own images (sysouts).

(Where does the link to the build topics fit into these pages?)

See README.md files in the GitHub repo.
