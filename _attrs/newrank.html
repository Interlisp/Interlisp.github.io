The original ranking algorithm in dot is recursive on clusters. This can produce fewer ranks
and a more compact layout, but sometimes at the cost of a head node being place on a higher
rank than the tail node. It also assumes that a node is not constrained in separate, 
incompatible subgraphs. For example, a node cannot be in a cluster and also be constrained by
<TT>rank=same</TT> with a node not in the cluster.
<P>
If <TT>newrank=true</TT>, the ranking algorithm does a single global ranking, ignoring clusters.
This allows nodes to be subject to multiple constraints. Rank constraints will usually take
precedence over edge constraints.
