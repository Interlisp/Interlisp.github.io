Vertical placement of labels for nodes, root graphs and clusters.
<P>
For graphs and clusters, only "t" and "b" are allowed, corresponding
to placement at the top and bottom, respectively.
By default, root
graph labels go on the bottom and cluster labels go on the top.
Note that a subgraph inherits attributes from its parent. Thus, if
the root graph sets <B>labelloc</B> to "b", the subgraph inherits
this value.
<P>
For nodes, this attribute is used only when the height of the node
is larger than the height of its label. 
If <TT>labelloc</TT> is set to "t", "c", or "b", the label is aligned
with the top, centered, or aligned with the bottom of the node, respectively.
In the default case, the label is vertically centered.
