We use donations to pay for online services, web hosting; larger donations for hiring consultants and contract workers to help with various tasks.

- Contact [our donations team](mailto:finance@interlisp.org) for larger amounts
- Benevity: for corporate donations InterlispOrg can be found on the Benevity portal by either searching for “Interlisp” or the organization numbered 840-872528093
