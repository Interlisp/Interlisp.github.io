While running Medley Online is relatively seamless, there are a few glitches taht can be seriously annoying.

## Browser defined control-W action

Many browsers interpret control-W as meaning "Close this Window".
This page lists some workarounds.
On a Mac, you can disable or change the Command+W shortcut in Safari (or any other application) by following these stepsÂ¹:

1. From the Apple menu in the top left corner of the screen, select System Preferences.
2. Click on Keyboard then Shortcuts then App Shortcuts.
3. Click the + button to add a new shortcut.
4. Select Safari.app for the application, and for the command, type Close Tab (this is case sensitive).
5. In the shortcut box, give it a different shortcut, like Command+Control+W.

Now Command+W will not close your Safari tabs. Please note that this change will only affect Safari, and Command+W will still close tabs and windows in other applications.

Remember, these changes can affect how other websites and applications behave, so use them with caution.

## Turn off control-W in other browsers

((Look up and follow directions))
