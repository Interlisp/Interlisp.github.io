`sfdp` stands for Scalable Force Directed Placement.

`sfdp` is a fast, multilevel, force-directed algorithm that efficiently layouts large graphs, outlined in "Efficient and High Quality Force-Dircted Graph Drawing"[^1].

Multiscale version of the [`fdp`](/docs/layouts/fdp/) layout, for the layout of large graphs.
