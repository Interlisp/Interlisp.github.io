Directory list used by libgd to search for bitmap fonts if Graphviz
was not built with the fontconfig library.
If <B>fontpath</B> is not set, the environment
variable <TT>DOTFONTPATH</TT> is checked.
If that is not set, <TT>GDFONTPATH</TT> is checked.
If not set, libgd uses its compiled-in font path.
Note that fontpath is an attribute of the root graph.
