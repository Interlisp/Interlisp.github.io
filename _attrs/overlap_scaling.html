When <TT>overlap=prism</TT>, the layout is scaled by this factor, thereby
removing a fair amount of node overlap, and making node overlap removal
faster and better able to retain the graph's shape.
<P>
If <TT>overlap_scaling</TT> is negative, the layout is scaled by
<TT>-1*overlap_scaling</TT> times the average label size.
If <TT>overlap_scaling</TT> is positive, the layout is scaled by
<TT>overlap_scaling</TT>.
If <TT>overlap_scaling</TT> is zero, no scaling is done.
