`fdp` stands for Force Directed Placement.

"spring model" layouts similar to those of [neato]({{< ref "neato.md" >}}), but
does this by reducing forces rather than working with energy.

`fdp` implements the Fruchterman-Reingold heuristic[^1] including a multigrid solver
that handles larger graphs and clustered undirected graphs.
