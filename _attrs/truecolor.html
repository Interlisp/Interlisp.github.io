If set explicitly to true or false, the value determines whether or not
internal bitmap rendering relies on a truecolor color model or uses
a color palette.
If the attribute is unset, truecolor is not used
unless there is a <A HREF=#d:shapefile>shapefile</A> property
for some node in the graph.
The output model will use the input model when possible.
<P>
Use of color palettes results in less memory usage during creation of the
bitmaps and smaller output files.
<P>
Usually, the only time it is necessary to specify the truecolor model
is if the graph uses more than 256 colors.
However, if one uses <A HREF=#d:bgcolor>bgcolor</A>=transparent with
a color palette, font
antialiasing can show up as a fuzzy white area around characters.
Using <B>truecolor</B>=true avoids this problem.
