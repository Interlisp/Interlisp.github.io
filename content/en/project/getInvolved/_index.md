There several ways to get involved in the Medley Interlisp Project, depending on your background and interests. These are elaborated below:

1. [Try it!](/software) We've tried to make it easy.
2. Look at, comment on, and contribute to Interlisp on GitHub.
3. Join in the discussions through a variety of interfaces.
4. Participate in weekly meetings; Read meeting agendas and notes.
5. Propose a project you want to take on, with help and guidance from us.
6. [Donate](/project/donate).

## 1. Try it!

We're actively trying to improve the new user experience, but don't expect a polished commercial product--we're still in the middle of restoration. But things are pretty stable. [online.interlisp.org](https://online.interlisp.org) should get you started. Type in (+ 1 2 3).

## 2. GitHub

We work primarily through [the Interlisp repositories on GitHub](https://github.com/Interlisp). While there are several repositories for the project, issues (problem reports) are to be found in the [medley repo issue list](https://github.com/Interlisp/medley/issues). If you have a GitHub account, you can watch the repositories of interest (medley, maiko, online).

Bug reports, feature requests, documentation problems, and questions are posted as [GitHub issues in the Medley repository](https://github.com/Interlisp/medley/issues). Do check to see if your issue or question is answered there first.

* [Medley](https://github.com/Interlisp/medley): Lisp code, build scripts and GitHub automation
* [Maiko](https://github.com/Interlisp/maiko): The C-coded virtual machine
* [Online](https://github.com/Interlisp/online): The JavaScript code, deployment scripts, and support resources for Medley Online
* [Interlisp.github.io](https://github.com/Interlisp/Interlisp.github.io#README): The Hugo source code for the interlisp.org site

## 3. Join in the discussions

### Discussion board

The [discussion board on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/Interlisp/discussions) is for general discussions and questions on the Medley environment, the Interlisp language, and Lisp development on the Medley system.

### Social media accounts

You can follow our official social media accounts.

* [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@interlisp)
* [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/interlisp.org)
* [LinkedIn group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/14632887)

We no longer use or monitor our [X/Twitter account](https://x.com/interlisp8) and have no presence on Facebook.

### EMail

There are two Google groups (mailing lists):

* [Interlisp](mailto:interlisp@googlegroups.com), archives [here](https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/interlisp)
* [LispCore](mailto:lispcore@googlegroups.com), archives [here](https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/lispcore)

The archives are public. The LispCore group gets much more email, and posts from non-members are moderated.

You can email us at [info@interlisp.org](mailto:info@interlisp.org)

### Online communities

We do not monitor these online communities but are looking for volunteers to monitor them for Interlisp discussions:

* [r/lisp](reddit.com/r/lisp) on Reddit.
* [Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat) has a #Interlisp IRC Channel. A place for informal chat. Connect by pointing your IRC client to `irc.libera.chat:6697` (TLS) and `/join #interlisp`. Say hello. There are also channels for #lisp (any dialect) and #common-lisp.
* [Lisp-Romania] has a Discord Interlisp channel.

## 4. Weekly meetings. We have weekly video conferencing meetings:

Mondays:    2pm PT/5pm ET. Implementation -- technical discussions  
Wednesdays: 10:30am PT/1:30pm ET. Communication -- website, talks,
                             documentation, bibliography, etc.  

Meetings are to report accomplishments, status, plans, and problems, and discuss directions. Meetings are recorded, but recordings are not public.

If you would like to join our weekly meetings, [let us know](mailto:info@interlisp.org).

## 5. Medley Projects

Check out our [Project List](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ceXj7VzPeLSM0sBwEnYQqArKsXg0VKCWLTF0zv10LRg/edit?usp=sharing) for ideas. Find something that matches your interests, or propose a different project. Funding is available to help support a limited number of projects.
