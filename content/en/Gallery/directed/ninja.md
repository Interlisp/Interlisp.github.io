[Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/), a small, fast build system, can output graphviz dependency graphs.

This is Ninja's dependency graph when building Ninja itself, auto-generated by running

```bash
ninja -t graph [mytarget]
```

See the [Ninja manual](https://ninja-build.org/manual.html) for details.
