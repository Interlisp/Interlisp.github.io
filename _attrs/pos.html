Position of node, or spline control points.
For nodes, the position indicates the center of the node.
On output, the coordinates are in <A HREF=#points>points</A>.
<P>
In neato and fdp, pos can be used to set the initial position of a node.
By default, the coordinates are assumed to be in inches. However, the
<A HREF=command.html#d:s>-s</A> command line flag can be used to specify
different units. As the output coordinates are in points, 
feeding the output of a graph laid out by a Graphviz program into
neato or fdp will almost always require the -s flag.
<P>
When the <A HREF=command.html#d:n>-n</A> command line flag is used with
neato, it is assumed the positions have been set by one of the layout
programs, and are therefore in points. Thus, <TT>neato -n</TT> can accept
input correctly without requiring a <TT>-s</TT> flag and, in fact,
ignores any such flag.
