3. Choose the release you are interested in (most likely the release marked ***Latest***) and click on the arrow next the word ***Assets*** to reveal the list of assets (i.e., installation files) for that release.   

4. Click on the link that ends with ***.tgz*** and begins with either ***medley-full-wsl-x86_64*** (if you are installing on an x86_64-based machine)  or ***medley-full-wsl-aarch64***(if you are installing on an Arm64-based machine)  to download the .tgz install file.
