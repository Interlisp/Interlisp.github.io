## Welcome to Interlisp.org

### Explore the Medley Interlisp Project

Interlisp was a pioneering software development environment from the 1970s at Xerox PARC targeted primarily at the AI software development community. A group of its developers and users have gotten together to revive Interlisp -- as a language, environment, spirit -- in the Medley Interlisp Project.

Because Interlisp has been around a long time, with multiple iterations, you might find the multitude of names for the Interlisp language and related companies confusing. To assist, we have created a <a href=project/vocabulary> list of common vocabulary you will find on this website.</a>
