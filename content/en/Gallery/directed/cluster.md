This small example illustrates dot's feature to draw nodes
and edges in *clusters* or separate rectangular layout regions.
Clusters are encoded as subgraphs whose names have the
prefix 'cluster'.  The color attribute of a cluster is
interpreted as its outline color or its background color
if its style is 'filled'.  Mdiamond and Msquare 
are modified symbols for data flow diagrams.
