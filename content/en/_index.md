## Welcome to Interlisp.org
### Explore the Medley Interlisp Project

Interlisp was a pioneering software development environment from the 1970s at Xerox PARC targeted primarily at the AI software development community. A group of its developers and users have gotten together to revive Interlisp -- as a language, environment, spirit -- in the Medley Interlisp Project.
