# Interlisp: A Brief History

Interlisp is a software development environment originating at BBN and subsequently developed at Xerox PARC in the 1970s and 1980s. Interlisp evolved from an interactive terminal style programming tool with the (at the time unusual) idea that a computer should spend "cycles" doing work to help the user recover from a programming error or understand someone else's code. 

Interlisp was recognized for its pioneering work in programming environments, winning the 1992 ACM Software System Award. Its features, such as structure editing, source code management, code analysis, and cross-referencing, facilitated rapid incremental development.  Interlisp was both a dialect of Lisp and an implementation of debugging and software development tools.

After the Xerox Alto, PARC and Xerox Office Systems started developing a set of machines, known as D-machines, included the Dorado, Dolphin, Dandelion, and Daybreak models. These systems shared many common properties: a personal workstation, single address space, mouse and pointer, large (black on white) bitmap display.

The development of Interlisp-D happened in an environment of cooperation and building on each other's ideas. Each IDE has its unique strengths and catered to different programming paradigms - Smalltalk with its object-oriented system, Cedar/Mesa with its strongly typed language, and Interlisp with its focus on AI and exploratory development. This diversity not only provided a rich set of tools for developers but also encouraged learning from each other's work and building upon it. 

Over its lifetime, the system has been known by different names. It was marketed by Xerox in the Xerox Artificial Intelligence Systems division, Envos, and Venue. The [glossary](/history/glossary) should help.

With the advent of RISC and the Sun Workstation, it was feasible to move from microcoded Virtual Machine emulator to one written in C; this work was initiated by Fuji Xerox and carried out through collaboriation.

The Medley Interlisp Project started with sources from Venue for what was intended to be Medley 3.5.

At the time 20 years ago, the computers that could run medley were expensive and slow.

BUt now, with Medley's 3.5 having 16 times the address space, and file access more than 1000 faster, there are interesting possibilities for future development of paths previously abandoned.
