  <h1>The Interlisp Revival</h1>
</header>x

<p>Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) is remembered mainly as the birthplace of the modern graphical user interface, influencing the development of the graphical operating systems we know today. At the same time PARC did pioneering work in the field of AI using a language called Interlisp. This powerful programmable language became the basis of Medley, a graphical software environment that carried on the design thinking of PARC's original Alto interface.</p>

<p>Medley's life as a commercial product ended in 1993(???) with _____, and until 2009 its source code only remained in the hands of the development team. Now the system is running again on modern computer systems, thanks tothe combined efforts of original developers and newcomers. Our goal is to revive Interlisp in language, environment and spirit through the Medley Interlisp Project.</p>
