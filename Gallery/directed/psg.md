"I made a program to generate dot files representing the LR(0) state graph along with computed LALR(1) lookahead for an arbitrary context-free grammar, to make the diagrams I used in this article: http://blog.lab49.com/archives/2471. The program also highlights errant nodes in red if the grammar would produce a shift/reduce or reduce/reduce conflict -- you may be able to go to http://kthielen.dnsalias.com:8082/ to produce a graph more to your liking".
