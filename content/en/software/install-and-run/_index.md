Packaged releases of Medley are available for Linux (most recent distros), MacOS and Windows 10/11.  Both x86_64 and Arm64 systems are supported (as well as Arm7 - e.g., Raspberry Pi - for Linux).  Instructions for installing and running Medley on these platforms are linked below.

Medley is capable of running on a variety of other OSes including FreeBSD and Solaris as well as on other CPU architectures including i386, SPARC, PowerPC, and Risc-V.  To install and run Medley on these platforms, you will need to build Medley (and its underlying virtual machine, *Maiko*) from the sources available in the Interlisp repos on github.com.  Instructions for building Medley and Maiko can be be found on github in the [*readme* for Maiko](https://github.com/interlisp/maiko) and the [*readme* for Medley](https://github.com/interlisp/medley).
