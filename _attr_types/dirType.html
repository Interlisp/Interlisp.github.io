For an edge <CODE>T -> H;</CODE>
  <TABLE>
  <TR><TD>"forward"<TD><IMG SRC="forward.gif">
      <TD>"back"<TD><IMG SRC="back.gif"></TR>
  <TR><TD>"both"<TD><IMG SRC="both.gif">
      <TD>"none"<TD><IMG SRC="nohead.gif"></TR>
  </TABLE>
That is, a glyph is drawn at the head end of an edge if and only
if dirType is "forward" or "both";
a glyph is drawn at the tail end of an edge if and only
if dirType is "back" or "both";
<P>
For undirected edges <CODE>T -- H;</CODE>, one of the nodes, usually
the righthand one, is treated as the head for the purpose of
interpreting "forward" and "back".
