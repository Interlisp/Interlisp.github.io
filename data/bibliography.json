The patterns and formats are greatly generalized versions of the left-half and right-half rules of COMIT and SNOBOL. For example, elementary patterns and formats can be variable names, results of computations, disjunctive sets, or repeating subpatterns; predicates can be associated with elementary patterns which check relationships among separated elements of the match; it is no longer necessary to restrict the operations to linear strings since elementary patterns can themselves match structures.

The programming language FLIP is presented here as a paradigm for such a feature. The design and implementation of FLIP discussed below emphasizes compact notation and efficiency of operation. In addition, FLIP is a modular language and can be readily extended and generalized to include features found in other pattern driven languages such as CONVERT and SNOBOL. This makes it extremely versatile. The development of this paper proceeds from abstract considerations to specific details. The syntax and semantics of FLIP are presented first, followed by a discussion of the implementation with especial attention devoted to techniques used for reducing the number of conses required as well as improving search strategy. Finally FLIP is treated as a working system and viewed from the users standpoint.

Most modern display equipment uses 10 bit digital to analog converters, providing for display in a 1024 by 1024 square raster. The actual resolution available is usually somewhat less since adjacent spots or lines will overlap. Even large-screen displays have limited resolution, for although they give a bigger picture, they also draw wider lines so that the amount of material which can appear at one time is still limited. Users of larger paper drawings have become accustomed to having a great deal of material presented at once. The computer display scope alone cannot serve the many tasks which require relatively large drawings with fine details.",

Unlike automated programming, which focuses on developing systems that write programs, automated programmering involves developing systems which automate (or at least greatly facilitate) those tasks that a programmer performs other than writing programs: e.g., repairing syntactical errors to get programs to run in the first place, generating test cases, making tentative changes, retesting, undoing changes, reconfiguring, massive edits, et al., plus repairing and recovering from mistakes made during the above. When the system in which the programmer is operating is cooperative and helpful with respect to these activities, the programmer can devote more time and energy to the task of programming itself, i.e., to conceptualizing, designing and implementing. Consequently, he can be more ambitious, and more productive.",

INTERLISP is designed to provide the user access to the large virtual memory allowed by TENEX, with a relatively small penalty in speed (using special paging techniques described in <*R2>). Additional data types have been added, including strings, arrays, and hash association tables (hash links). The system includes a compatible compiler and interpreter. Machine code can be intermixed with INTERLISP expressions via the assemble directive of the compiler. The compiler also contains a facility for \"block compilation\" which allows a group of functions to be compiled as a unit, suppressing internal names. Each successive level of computation, from interpreted through compiled, to block-compiled provides greater speed at a cost of debugging ease.",

      "abstractNote": "INTERLISP (INTERactive LISP) is a LISP system currently implemented on the DEC PDP-10 under the BBN TENEX time sharing system<*R1>. INTERLISP is designed to provide the user access to the large virtual memory allowed by TENEX, with a relatively small penalty in speed (using special paging techniques described in <*R2>). Additional data types have been added, including strings, arrays, and hash association tables (hash links). The system includes a compatible compiler and interpreter. Machine code can be intermixed with INTERLISP expressions via the assemble directive of the compiler. The compiler also contains a facility for \"block compilation\" which allows a group of functions to be compiled as a unit, suppressing internal names. Each successive level of computation, from interpreted through compiled, to block-compiled provides greater speed at a cost of debugging ease.",

It also incorporates some knowledge, gained by the author from both experiment and introspection, about how programs are often constructed, and uses this knowledge to guide the proof process. It uses its knowledge, plus contextual information from the program being verified, to simplify the theorems dramatically as they are being constructed, rather than relying on a super-powerful proof procedure.

That is, it can be useful to have an effective extra bit, field, or address in some words without every word having to contain a bit (or bits) to mark this as a special case. The key idea is that this extra associated information can be found by a table search. Although it could be found by any search technique (e.g. linear, binary sorted, etc.), we suggest that an appropriate low overhead mechanism is to use hash search on a table in which the key is the address of the cell to be augmented.",

The system described in this paper makes extensive use of a bit map display and pointing device (a mouse) to significantly enrich the user's interactions with the system, and to provide capabilities not possible with terminals that essentially emulate hard copy devices. For example, any text that is displayed on the screen can be pointed at and treated as input, exactly as though it were typed, i.e., the user can say use this expression or that value, and then simply point. The user views his programming environment through a collection of display windows, each of which corresponds to a different task or context. The user can manipulate the windows, or the contents of a particular window, by a combination of keyboard inputs or pointing operations. The technique of using different windows for different tasks makes it easy for the user to manage several simultaneous tasks and contexts, e.g., defining programs, testing programs, editing, asking the system for assistance, sending and receiving messages, etc and to switch back and forth between these tasks at his convenience.",

The system described in this paper makes extensive use of a bit map display and pointing device (a mouse) to significantly enrich the user's interactions with the system, and to provide capabilities not possible with terminals that essentially emulate hard copy devices. For example, any text that is displayed on the screen can be pointed at and treated as input, exactly as though it were typed, i.e. the user can say use this expression or that value, and then simply point. The user views his programming environment through a collection of display windows, each of which corresponds to a different task or context. The user can manipulate the windows, or the contents of a particular window, by a combination of keyboard inputs or pointing operations. The technique of using different windows for different tasks makes it easy for the user to manage several simultaneous tasks and contexts, e.g. defining programs, testing programs, editing, asking the system for assistance, sending and receiving messages, etc. and to switch back and forth between these tasks at his convenience.",

The system described in this paper makes extensive use of a bit map display and pointing device (a mouse) to significantly enrich the user's interactions with the system, and to provide capabilities not possible with terminals that essentially emulate hard copy devices. For example, any text that is displayed on the screen can be pointed at and treated as input, exactly as though it were typed, i.e. the user can say use this expression or that value, and then simply point. The user views his programming environment through a collection of display windows, each of which corresponds to a different task or context. The user can manipulate the windows, or the contents of a particular window, by a combination of keyboard inputs or pointing operations. The technique of using different windows for different tasks makes it easy for the user to manage several simultaneous tasks and contexts, e.g. defining programs, testing programs, editing, asking the system for assistance, sending and receiving messages, etc. and to switch back and forth between these tasks at his convenience.",

For example, any text that is displayed on the screen can be pointed at and treated as input, exactly as though it were typed, i.e. the user can say use this expression or that value, and then simply point. The user views his programming environment through a collection of display windows, each of which corresponds to a different task or context. The user can manipulate the windows, or the contents of a particular window, by a combination of keyboard inputs or pointing operations. The technique of using different windows for different tasks makes it easy for the user to manage several simultaneous tasks and contexts, e.g. defining programs, testing programs, editing, asking the system for assistance, sending and receiving messages, etc. and to switch back and forth between these tasks at his convenience.",

In order to extrapolate our results to larger systems than those measured, we propose a model for the generation of list pointers and we test the model against data from two programs. We show that according to our model, list structures with compact cdr fields will, as address space grows, continue to be compacted well with a fixed-width small field. Our conclusion is that with a microcodable processor, about a factor of two gain in space efficiency for list structure can be had for little or no cost in processing time.",

The compiler and optimization phase are machine independent, in that they generate a stream of instructions for an abstract stack machine, which an assembler subsequently turns into the actual machine instructions.

We felt that there were twe useful functions such an issue could serve. First, we hoped to elicit a clear picture of how people working in this subdiscipline understand knowledge representation research, to illuminate the issues on which current research is focused, and to catalogue what approaches and techniques are currently being developed. Second -- and this is why we envisaged the issue as a survey of many different groups and projects -- we wanted to provide a document that would enable the reader to acquire at least an approximate sense of how each of the many different research endesvours around the world fit into the field as a whole.It would of course be impossible to produce a final or definitive document accomplishing these goals: rather, we hoped that this survey could initiate a continuing dialogue on issues in representation, a project for which this newsletter seems the ideal forum. It has been many months since our original decision was made, but we are finally able to present the results of that survey. Perhaps more than anything else, it has emerged as a testament to an astounding range and variety of opinions held by many different people in many different places.The following few pages are intended as an introduction to the survey as a whole, and to this issue of the newsletter. We will briefly summarize the form that the survey took, discuss the strategies we followed in analyzing and tabulating responses, briefly review the overall sense we received from the answers that were submitted, and discuss various criticisms which were submitted along with the responses. The remainder of the volume has been designed to be roughly self-explanatory at each point, so that one may dip into it at different places at will. Certain conventions, however, particularly regarding indexing and tabulating, will also be explained in the remainder of this introduction.As editors, we are enormously grateful to the many people who devoted substantial effort to responding to our survey. It is our hope that the material presented here will be interesting and helpful to our readers, and that fruitful discussion of these and other issues will continue energetically and enthusiastically into the future.",

This implementation has the following goals:\n• To be compatible with and functionally equivalent to Interlisp-10.\n\n• To serve as a basis for future Interlisp implementations on other mainframe computers. This goal requires that the implementation to be portable.\n\n• To support a large virtual address space.\n\n• To achieve a reasonable speed.\n\nThe implementation draws directly from three sources, Interlisp-10 [19], Interlisp-D [5], and Multilisp [12]. Interlisp-10, the progenitor of all Interlisps, runs on the PDP-10 under the TENEX [2] and TOPS-20 operating systems. Interlisp-D, developed at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, runs on personal computers also developed at PARC. Multilisp, developed at the University of British Columbia, is a portable interpreter containing a kernel of Interlisp, written in Pascal [9] and running on the IBM Series/370 and the VAX. The Interlisp-VAX implementation relies heavily on these implementations. In turn, Interlisp-D and Multilisp were developed from The Interlisp Virtual Machine Specification [15] by J Moore (subsequently referred to as the VM specification), which discusses what is needed to implement an Interlisp by describing an Interlisp Virtual Machine from the implementors' point of view. Approximately six man-years of effort have been spent exclusively in developing Interlisp-VAX, plus the benefit of many years of development for the previous Interlisp implementations.",

      "abstract": "Conversion of the LogLispLogic programming in Lisp Artificial Intelligence programming environment from its original RutgersUCI-Lisp RUCI-Lisp implementation to an InterLisp implementation is described. This report may be useful to researchers wishing to convert LogLisp to yet another Lisp dialect, or to those wishing to convert other RUCI-Lisp programs into InterLisp. It is also intended to help users of the InterLisp version of LogLisp to understand the implementation. The conversion process is described at a level aimed toward potential translators who might benefit from approaches taken and lessons learned. General issues of conversion of Lisp software between dialects are discussed, use of InterLisps dialect translation package is described, and specific issues of non-mechanizable conversion are addressed. The latter include dialect differences in function definitions, arrays, integer arithmetic, io, interrupts, and macros. Subsequent validation, compilation, and efficiency enhancement of the InterLisp version are then described. A brief users guide to the InterLisp version and points of contact for information on LogLisp software distribution are also provided. Author",

This report may be useful to researchers wishing to convert LogLisp to yet another Lisp dialect, or to those wishing to convert other RUCI-Lisp programs into InterLisp. It is also intended to help users of the InterLisp version of LogLisp to understand the implementation. The conversion process is described at a level aimed toward potential translators who might benefit from approaches taken and lessons learned. General issues of conversion of Lisp software between dialects are discussed, use of InterLisps dialect translation package is described, and specific issues of non-mechanizable conversion are addressed. The latter include dialect differences in function definitions, arrays, integer arithmetic, io, interrupts, and macros. Subsequent validation, compilation, and efficiency enhancement of the InterLisp version are then described. A brief users guide to the InterLisp version and points of contact for information on LogLisp software distribution are also provided. Author",

      "abstract": "This paper introduces a special programming environment for the definition of grammars and for the implementation of corresponding parsers. In natural language processing systems it is advantageous to have linguistic knowledge and processing mechanisms separated. Our environment accepts grammars consisting of binary dependency relations and grammatical functions. Well-formed expressions of functions and relations provide constituent surroundings for syntactic categories in the form of two-way automata. These relations, functions, and automata are described in a special definition language.In focusing on high level descriptions a linguist may ignore computational details of the parsing process.

      "abstractNote": "This paper introduces a special programming environment for the definition of grammars and for the implementation of corresponding parsers. In natural language processing systems it is advantageous to have linguistic knowledge and processing mechanisms separated. Our environment accepts grammars consisting of binary dependency relations and grammatical functions. Well-formed expressions of functions and relations provide constituent surroundings for syntactic categories in the form of two-way automata. These relations, functions, and automata are described in a special definition language.In focusing on high level descriptions a linguist may ignore computational details of the parsing process. He writes the grammar into a DPL-description and a compiler translates it into efficient LISP-code. The environment has also a tracing facility for the parsing process, grammar-sensitive lexical maintenance programs, and routines for the interactive graphic display of parse trees and grammar definitions. Translator routines are also available for the transport of compiled code between various LISP-dialects. The environment itself exists currently in INTERLISP and FRANZLISP.

      "abstractNote": "CommonLoops blends object-oriented programming smoothly and tightly with the procedure-oriented design of Lisp. Functions and methods are combined in a more general abstraction. Message passing is invoked via normal Lisp function call. Methods are viewed as partial descriptions of procedures. Lisp data types are integrated with object classes. With these integrations, it is easy to incrementally move a program between the procedure and object-oriented styles. One of the most important properties of CommonLoops is its extensive use of meta-objects. We discuss three kinds of meta-objects: objects for classes, objects for methods, and objects for discriminators. We argue that these meta-objects make practical both efficient implementation and experimentation with new ideas for object-oriented programming. CommonLoops' small kernel is powerful enough to implement the major object-oriented systems in use today.",

For the programmer, It provides a rich graphical interface for the creation of rich graphical interfaces. In the service of an end user, It provides classes for modeling the graphical relationships of objects on the screen and maintaining constraints between them. Several large applications have been developed with Chips including intelligent tutors for programming and electricity. Chips is implemented as a collection of customizable classes in the LOOPS object-oriented extensions to Interlisp-D. The three fundamental classes are 1 DomainObject which defines objects of the application domain - the domain for which the interface is being built - and ties together the various functionalities provided by the Chips system 2 DisplayObject which defines mouse-sensitive graphical objects and 3 Substrate which defines specialized windows for displaying and storing collections of instances of DisplayObject. A programmer creates an interface by specializing existing DomainObjects and drawing new Displayobjects with a graphics editor. Instances of DispalyObject and Substrate are assembled on screen to form the interface. Once the interface has been sketched in this manner, the programmer can build inward, creating all other parts of the application through the objects on the screen.",

      "abstract": "During my tenure as Chairman of the Department of Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, 1955 to 1970, two points became clear in regard to diagnosis in internal medicine. The first was that the knowledge base in that field had become vastly too large for any single person to encompass it. The second point was that the busy practitioner, even though he knew the items of information pertinent to his patients correct diagnosis, often did not consider the right answer particularly if the diagnosis was an unusual disease. I resigned the position of Chairman in 1970 intending to resume my position as Professor of Medicine. However, the University saw fit to offer me the appointment as University Professor (Medicine). The University of Pittsburgh follows the practice of Harvard University, established by President James Bryant Conant in the late 1930s, in which a University Professor is a professor at large and reports only to the president of the university. He has no department, no school and is not under administrative supervision by a dean or vice-president. Thus the position allows maximal academic freedom. In this new position I felt strongly that I should conduct worthwhile research. It was almost fifteen years since I had worked in my chosen field of clinical investigation, namely splanchnic blood flow and metabolism, and I felt that research in that area had passed me by. Remembering the two points mentioned earlier — the excessive knowledge base of internal medicine and the problem of considering the correct diagnosis — I asked myself what could be done to correct these problems. It seemed that the computer with its huge memory could correct the first and I wondered if it could not help as well with the second. At that point I knew no more about computers than the average layman so I sought advice. Dr. Gerhard Werner, our Chairman of Pharmacology, was working with computers in an attempt to map all of the neurological centers of the human brain stem with particular reference to their interconnections and functions. He was particularly concerned about the actions of pharmacological agents on this complex system. Working with him on this problem was Dr. Harry Pople, a computer scientist with special interest in “artificial intelligence”. The problem chosen was so complex and difficult that Werner and Pople were making little progress. Gerhard listened patiently to my ideas and promptly stated that he thought the projects were feasible utilizing the computer. In regard to the diagnostic component of my ambition he strongly advised that “artificial intelligence” be used. Pople was brought into the discussion and was greatly interested, I believe because of the feasibility of the project and the recognition of its practical application to the practice of medicine. The upshot was that Pople joined me in my project and Werner and Pople abandoned the work on the brain stem. Pople knew nothing about medicine and I knew nothing about computer science. Thus the first step in our collaboration was my analysis for Pople of the diagnostic process. I chose a goodly number of actual cases from clinical pathological conferences (CPCs) because they contained ample clinical data and because the correct diagnoses were known. At each small step of the way through the diagnostic process I was required to explain what the clinical information meant in context and my reasons for considering certain diagnoses. This provided to Pople insight into the diagnostic process. After analyzing dozens of such cases I felt as though I had undergone a sort of “psychoanalysis”. From this experience Pople wrote the first computer diagnostic programs seeking to emulate my diagnostic process. This has led certain “wags” to nickname our project “Jack in the box”. For this initial attempt Pople used the LISP computer language. We were granted access to the PROPHET PDP-10, a time-sharing mainframe maintained in Boston by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) but devoted particularly to pharmacological research. Thus we were interlopers. The first name we applied to our project was DIALOG, for diagnostic logic, but this had to be dropped because the name was in conflict with a computer program already on the market and copyrighted. The next name chosen was INTERNIST for obvious reason. However, the American Society for Internal Medicine publishes a journal entitled “The Internist” and they objected to our use of INTERNIST although there seems to be little relationship or conflict between a printed journal and a computer software program. Rather than fight the issue we simply added the Roman numeral one to our title which then became INTERNIST-I, which continues to this day. Pople's initial effort was unsuccessful, however. He diligently had incorporated details regarding anatomy and much basic pathophysiology, I believe because in my initial CPC analyses I had brought into consideration such items of information so that Pople could understand how I got from A to B etc. The diagnostician in internal medicine knows, of course, much anatomy and patho-physiology but these are brought into consideration in only a minority of diagnostic problems. He knows, for example, that the liver is in the right upper quadrant and just beneath the right leaf of the diaphragm. In most diagnostic instances this information is “subconscious”. Our first computer diagnostic program included too many such details and as a result was very slow and frequently got into analytical “loops” from which it could not extricate itself. We decided that we had to simplify the program but by that juncture much of 1971 had passed on. The new program was INTERNIST-I and even today most of the basic structure devised in 1972 remains intact. INTERNIST-I is written in INTERLISP and has operated on the PDP-10 and the DEC 2060. It has also been adapted to the VAX 780. Certain younger people have contributed significantly to the program, particularly Dr. Zachary Moraitis and Dr. Randolph Miller. The latter interrupted his regular medical school education to spend the year 1974-75 as a fellow in our laboratory and since finishing his formal medical education in 1979 has been active as a full time faculty member of the team. Several Ph.D. candidates in computer science have also made significant contributions as have dozens of medical students during electives on the project. INTERNIST-I is really quite a simple system as far as its operating system or inference engine is concerned. Three basic numbers are concerned in and manipulated in the ranking of elicited disease hypotheses. The first of these is the importance (IMPORT) of each of the more than 4,100 manifestations of disease which are contained in the knowledge base. IMPORTS are a global representation of the clinical importance of a given finding graded from 1 to 5, the latter being maximal, focusing on how necessary it is to explain the manifestation regardless of the final diagnosis. Thus massive splenomegaly has an IMPORT of 5 whereas anorexia has an IMPORT of 1. Mathematical weights are assigned to IMPORT numbers on a non-linear scale. The second basic number is the evoking strength (EVOKS), the numbers ranging from 0 to 5. The number answers the question, that given a particular manifestation of disease, how strongly does one consider disease A versus all other diagnostic possibilities in a clinical situation. A zero indicates that a particular clinical manifestation is non-specific, i.e. so widely spread among diseases that the above question cannot be answered usefully. Again, anorexia is a good example of a non-specific manifestation. The EVOKS number 5, on the other hand, indicates that a manifestation is essentially pathognomonic for a particular disease. The third basic number is the frequency (FREQ) which answers the question that given a particular disease what is the frequency or incidence of occurrence of a particular clinical finding. FREQ numbers range from 1 to 5, one indicating that the finding is rare or unusual in the disease and 5 indicating that the finding is present in essentially all instances of the disease. Each diagnosis which is evoked is ranked mathematically on the basis of support for it, both positive and negative. Like the import number, the values for EVOKS and FREQ numbers increase in a non-linear fashion. The establishment or conclusion of a diagnosis is not based on any absolute score, as in Bayesian systems, but on how much better is the support of diagnosis A as compared to its nearest competitor. This difference is anchored to the value of an EVOKS of 5, a pathognomonic finding. When the list of evoked diagnoses is ranked mathematically on the basis of EVOKS, FREQ and IMPORT, the list is partitioned based upon the similarity of support for individual diagnoses. Thus a heart disease is compared with other heart diseases and not brain diseases since the patient may have a heart disorder and a brain disease concommitantly. Thus apples are compared with apples and not oranges. When a diagnosis is concluded, the computer consults a list of interrelationships among diseases (LINKS) and bonuses are awarded, again in a non-linear fashion for numbers ranging from 1 to 5 — 1 indicating a weak interrelationship and 5 a universal interrelationship. Thus multiple interrelated diagnoses are preferred over independent ones provided the support for the second and other diagnoses is adequate. Good clinicians use this same rule of thumb. LINKS are of various types: PCED is used when disease A precedes disease B, e.g. acute rheumatic fever precedes early rheumatic valvular disease; PDIS - disease A predisposes to disease B, e.g. AIDS predisposes to pneumocystis pneumonia; CAUS - disease A causes disease B, e.g. thrombophlebitis of the lower extremities may cause pulmonary embolism; and COIN - there is a statistical interrelationship between disease A and disease B but scientific medical information is not explicit on the relationship, e.g. Hashimoto's thyroiditis coincides with pernicious anemia, both so called autoimmune diseases. The maximal number of correct diagnoses made in a single case analysis is, to my recollection, eleven. In working with INTERNIST-I during the remainder of the 1970s several important points about the system were learned or appreciated. The first and foremost of these is the importance of a complete and accurate knowledge base. Omissions from a disease profile can be particularly troublesome. If a manifestation of disease is not listed on a disease profile the computer can only conclude that that manifestation does not occur in the disease, and if a patient demonstrates the particular manifestation it counts against the diagnosis. Fortunately, repeated exercise of the diagnostic system brings to attention many inadvertent omissions. It is important to establish the EVOKS and FREQ numbers as accurately as possible. Continual updating of the knowledge base, including newly described diseases and new information about diseases previously profiled, is critical. Dr. Edward Feigenbaum recognized the importance of the accuracy and completeness of knowledge bases as the prime requisite of expert systems of any sort. He emphasized this point in his keynote address to MEDINFO-86 (1). Standardized, clear and explicit nomenclature is required in expressing disease names and particularly in naming the thousands of individual manifestations of disease. Such rigidity can make the use of INTERNIST-I difficult for the uninitiated user. Therefore, in QMR more latitude and guidance is provided the user. For example, the user of INTERNIST-I must enter ABDOMEN PAIN RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT exactly whereas in QMR the user may enter PAI ABD RUQ and the system recognizes the term as above. The importance of “properties” attached to the great majority of clinical manifestations was solidly evident. Properties express such conditions that if A is true then B is automatically false (or true as the case may be). The properties also allow credit to be awarded for or against B as the case may be. Properties also provide order to the asking of questions in the interrogative mode. They also state prerequisites and unrequisites for various procedures. As examples, one generally does not perform a superficial lymph node biopsy unless lymph nodes are enlarged (prerequisite). Similarly, a percutaneous liver biopsy is inadvisable if the blood platelets are less than 50,000 (unrequisite). It became clear quite early in the utilization of INTERNIST-I that systemic or multisystem diseases had an advantage versus localized disorders in diagnosis. This is because systemic diseases have very long and more inclusive manifestation lists. It became necessary, therefore, to subdivide systemic diseases into various components when appropriate. Systemic lupus erythematosus provides a good example. Lupus nephritis must be compared in our system with other renal diseases and such comparison is allowed by our partitioning algorithm. Likewise, cerebral lupus must be differentiated from other central nervous system disorders. Furthermore, either renal lupus or cerebral lupus can occur at times without significant clinical evidence of other systemic involvement. In order to reassemble the components of a systemic disease we devised the systemic LINK (SYST) which expresses the interrelationship of each subcomponent to the parent systemic disease. It became apparent quite early that expert systems like INTERNIST do not deal with the time axis of a disease well at all, and this seems to be generally true of expert systems in “artificial intelligence”. Certain parameters dealing with time can be expressed by devising particular manifestations, e.g. a blood transfusion preceding the development of acute hepatitis B by 2 to 6 months. But time remains a problem which is yet to be solved satisfactorily including QMR. It has been clearly apparent over the years that both the knowledge base and the diagnostic consultant programs of both INTERNIST-I and QMR have considerable educational value. The disease profiles, the list of diseases in which a given clinical manifestation occurs (ordered by EVOKS and FREQ), and the interconnections among diseases (LINKS) provide a quick and ready means of acquiring at least orienting clinical information. Such has proved useful not only to medical students and residents but to clinical practitioners as well. In the interrogative mode of the diagnostic systems the student will frequently ask “Why was that question asked?” An instructor can either provide insight or ready consultation of the knowledge base by the student will provide a simple semi-quantitative reason for the question. Lastly, let the author state that working with INTERNIST-I and QMR over the years seems to have had real influence on his own diagnostic approaches and habits. Thus my original psycho-analysis when working with Pople has been reinforced.",

      "abstract": "Peptide synthesis is an important research tool. However, successful syntheses require considerable effort from the scientist. We have produced an expert System, the PepPro™ Peptide Synthesis Expert System, that helps the scientist improve peptide syntheses. To use PepPro the scientist enters the peptide to be synthesized. PepPro then applies its synthesis rules to analyze the peptide, to predict coupling. problems, and to recommend solutions. PepPro produces a synthesis report that summarizes the analysis and recommendations. The program includes a capability that allows the scientist to write new synthesis rules and add them to the PepPro knowledge base. PepPro was developed on Xerox 11xx series workstations using Beckman’s proprietary development environment MP). We then compiled PepPro to run on the IBM PC. PepPro has limitations that derive from unpredictable events during a synthesis. Despite the limitations, PepPro provides several important benefits. The major one is that it makes peptide syntheses easier, less time-consuming, and more efficient.",

In the system according to the invention a variety of development and execution tools are supported. The invention features a highly visual user presentation of a control system, including structure, specification, and operation, offering a user an interactive capability for rapid design, modification, and exploration of the operating characteristics of a control system comprising asynchronous processes. The invention captures a representation of the system (RS) that is equivalent to the actual system (AS)--rather than a simulation of the actual system. This allows the invention to perform tests and modification on RS instead of AS, yet get accurate results. RS and AS are equivalent because AS is generated directly from RS by an automated process. Effectively, pressing a button in the RS environment can \"create\" the AS version or any selected portion of it, by \"downloading\" a translation of the RS version that can be executed by a programmable processor in the AS environment. Information can flow both ways between AS and RS. That AS and RS can interact is important. This allows RS to \"take on\" the \"state\" of AS whenever desired, through an \"uploading\" procedure, thereby reflecting accurately the condition of AS at a specific point in time.",

Finally, that list of the image positions and the corresponding section and page numbers is displayed in a suitable fashion to inform a user of how to place the printing plates in the desired arrangement onto the printing units of the press to print this given edition.",

      "abstract": "Workspaces provided by an object-based user interface appear to share windows and other display objects. Each workspace's data structure includes, for each window in that workspace, a linking data structure called a placement which links to the display system object which provides that window, which may be a display system object in a preexisting window system. The placement also contains display characteristics of the window when displayed in that workspace, such as position and size. Therefore, a display system object can be linked to several workspaces by a placement in each of the workspaces' data structures, and the window it provides to each of those workspaces can have unique display characteristics, yet appear to the user to be the same window or versions of the same window. As a result, the workspaces appear to be sharing a window. Workspaces can also appear to share a window if each workspace's data structure includes data linking to another workspace with a placement to the shared window. The user can invoke a switch between workspaces by selecting a display object called a door, and a back door to the previous workspace is created automatically so that the user is not trapped in a workspace. A display system object providing a window to a workspace being left remains active so that when that workspace is reentered, the window will have the same contents as when it disappeared. Also, the placements of a workspace are updated so that when the workspace is reentered its windows are organized the same as when the user left that workspace. The user can enter an overview display which shows a representation of each workspace and the windows it contains so that the user can navigate to any workspace from the overview.",

Menus are constructed from interchangeable object building blocks to obtain the characteristics wanted without the need to write new code or code and maintaining a coherent interface standard. The approach is implemented by dissecting interface menu behavior into modularized objects specifying orthogonal components of desirable menu behaviors. Once primary characteristics for orthogonal dimensions of menu behavior are identified, individual objects are constructed to provide specific alternatives for the behavior within the definitions of each dimension. Finally, specific objects from each dimension are combined to construct a menu having the desired selections of menu behaviors.",

Menus are constructed from interchangeable object building blocks to obtain the characteristics wanted without the need to write new code or code and maintaining a coherent interface standard. The approach is implemented by dissecting interface menu behavior into modularized objects specifying orthogonal components of desirable menu behaviors. Once primary characteristics for orthogonal dimensions of menu behavior are identified, individual objects are constructed to provide specific alternatives for the behavior within the definitions of each dimension. Finally, specific objects from each dimension are combined to construct a menu having the desired selections of menu behaviors.",

      "container-title": "University of Toronto",
      "page": "187",
      "abstract": "History tools allow users to access past interactions kept in a history and to\nincorporate them into the context of their current operations. Such tools appear in\nvarious forms in many of today’s computing systems, but despite their prevalence,they have received little attention as user support tools. This dissertation investigates, through a series of studies, history–based, user support tools. The studies focus on three primary factors influencing the utility of history–based, user support tools: design of history tools, support of a behavioural phenomenon in user interactions, and mental and physical effort associated with using history tools. Design of history tools strongly influences a user’s perception of their utility. In surveying a wide collection of history tools, we identify seven independent uses of the information with no single history tool supporting all seven uses. Based on\ncognitive and behavioural considerations associated with the seven history uses,\nwe propose several kinds of history information and history functions that need to be supported in new designs of history tools integrating all seven uses of history. An exploratory study of the UNIX environment reveals that user interactions\nexhibit a behavioural phenomenon, nominally referred to as locality. This is the phenomenon where users repeatedly reference a small group of commands during extended intervals of their session. We apply two concepts from computer memory research (i.e., working sets and locality) to examine this behavioural artifact and to propose a strategy for predicting repetitive opportunities and candidates. Our studies reveal that users exhibit locality in only 31% of their sessions whereas users repeat individual commands in 75% of their sessions. We also found that history tool use occurs primarily in locality periods. Thus, history tools which localize their prediction opportunities to locality periods can predict effectively the reuse candidates.\nFinally, the effort, mental and physical, associated with using a history tool\nto expedite repetitive commands can influence a user’s decision to use history\ntools. We analyze the human information–processing operations involved in the task of specifying a recurrent command for a given approach and design (assuming that the command is fully generated and resides in the user’s working memory and that users exhibit expert, error–free task performance behaviour). We find that in most of the proposed history designs, users expend less physical effort at the expense of more mental effort. The increased mental effort can be alleviated by providing history tools which require simpler mental operations (e.g., working memory retrievals and perceptual processing). Also, we find that the typing approach requires less mental effort at the expense of more physical effort. Finally, despite the overhead associated with switching to the use of history tools, users (with a typing speed of 55 wpm or less) do expend less overall effort to specify recurrent commands (which have been generated and appear in working\nmemory) using history tools compared to typing from scratch. The results of the three sets of studies provide insights into current history tools and point favourably towards the use of history tools for user support, especially history tools that support the reuse of previous commands, but additional research into history tool designs and usability factors is needed. Our studies demonstrate the importance of considering various psychological and behavioural factors and the importance of different grains of analysis.",

      "abstract": "An approach to flexible hyperbase (hypertext database) support predicated on the notion of ex-tensibility is presented. The extensible hypertext platform (Hyperform) implements basic hyperbase services that can be tailored to provide specialised hyperbase support. Hypeeform is based on an inter-nal computational engine that provides an object-oriented extension language which allows new data model objects and operations to be added at run-time. Hyperform has a number of built-in classes to pro-vide basic hyperbase features such as concurrency control, notification control (events), access control, version control and search and query. Each of these classes can be specialised using multiple inheritance to form virtually any type of hyperbase support needed in next-generation hypertext systems.

      "abstractNote": "An approach to flexible hyperbase (hypertext database) support predicated on the notion of ex-tensibility is presented. The extensible hypertext platform (Hyperform) implements basic hyperbase services that can be tailored to provide specialised hyperbase support. Hypeeform is based on an inter-nal computational engine that provides an object-oriented extension language which allows new data model objects and operations to be added at run-time. Hyperform has a number of built-in classes to pro-vide basic hyperbase features such as concurrency control, notification control (events), access control, version control and search and query. Each of these classes can be specialised using multiple inheritance to form virtually any type of hyperbase support needed in next-generation hypertext systems. This approach greatly reduces the effort required to provide high-quality customized hyperbase support for distributed hypertext applications. Hyper-form is implemented and operational in Unix environments. This paper describes the Hyperform approach, discusses its advantages and disadvantages, and gives examples of simulating the 11AM and the Danish Hyperlime in Hyperform. Hyper-form is compared with related work from the HAM generation of hyperbase systems and the current status of the project is reviewed.",

Information about the states is included in the transition units, so that the encoded data structure can be written without state units of data. The incoming transition units to a final state each contain an indication of finality. The incoming transition units to a state which has no outgoing transition units each contain a branch ending indication. The outgoing transition units of each state are ordered into a comparison sequence for comparison with a received element, and all but the last outgoing transition unit contain an alternative indication of a subsequent alternative outgoing transition. The indications are incorporated with the label of each transition unit into a single byte, and the remaining byte values are allocated among a number of pointer data units, some of which begin full length pointers and some of which begin pointer indexes to tables where pointers are entered. The pointers may be used where a state has a large number of incoming transitions or where the block of transition units depending from a state is broken down to speed access. The first outgoing transition unit of a state is positioned immediately after one of the incoming transitions so that it may be found without a pointer. Each alternative outgoing transition unit is stored immediately after the block beginning with the previous outgoing transition unit so that it may be found by proceeding through the transition units until the number of alternative bits and the number of branch ending bits balance.",

      "abstractNote": "An FSM data structure is encoded by generating a transition unit of data corresponding to each transition which leads ultimately to a final state of the FSM. Information about the states is included in the transition units, so that the encoded data structure can be written without state units of data. The incoming transition units to a final state each contain an indication of finality. The incoming transition units to a state which has no outgoing transition units each contain a branch ending indication. The outgoing transition units of each state are ordered into a comparison sequence for comparison with a received element, and all but the last outgoing transition unit contain an alternative indication of a subsequent alternative outgoing transition. The indications are incorporated with the label of each transition unit into a single byte, and the remaining byte values are allocated among a number of pointer data units, some of which begin full length pointers and some of which begin pointer indexes to tables where pointers are entered. The pointers may be used where a state has a large number of incoming transitions or where the block of transition units depending from a state is broken down to speed access. The first outgoing transition unit of a state is positioned immediately after one of the incoming transitions so that it may be found without a pointer. Each alternative outgoing transition unit is stored immediately after the block beginning with the previous outgoing transition unit so that it may be found by proceeding through the transition units until the number of alternative bits and the number of branch ending bits balance.",

      "abstract": "CAST.FSM denotes a CAST tool which has been developed at the Institute of Systems Science at the University of Linz during the years 1986–1993. The first version of CAST.FSM was implemented in INTERLISP-D and LOOPS for the Siemens-Xerox workstation 5815 (“Dandelion”). CAST.FSM supports the application of the theory of finite state machines for hardware design tasks between the architecture level and the level of gate circuits. The application domain, to get practical experience for CAST.FSM, was the field of VLSI design of ASICS’s where the theory of finite state machines can be applied to improve the testability of such circuits (“design for testability”) and to optimise the required silicon area of the circuit (“floor planning”). An overview of CAST as a whole and of CAST.FSM as a CAST tool is given in [11]. In our presentation we want to report on the re-engineering of CAST.FSM and on new types of applications of CAST.FSM which are currently under investigation. In this context we will distinguish between three different problems:\n1.\nthe implementation of CAST.FSM in ANSI Common Lisp and the design of a new user interface by Rudolf Mittelmann [5].\n\n \n2.\nthe search for systemstheoretical concepts in modelling intelligent hierarchical systems based on the past work of Arthur Koestler [3] following the concepts presented by Franz Pichler in [10].\n\n \n3.\nthe construction of hierarchical formal models (of multi-layer type) to study attributes which are assumed for SOHO-structures (SOHO = Self Organizing Hierarchical Order) of A. Koestler.\n\n \nThe latter problem will deserve the main attention in our presentation. In the present paper we will build such a hierarchical model following the concepts of parallel decomposition of finite state machines (FSMs) and interpret it as a multi-layer type of model.",

      "abstractNote": "CAST.FSM denotes a CAST tool which has been developed at the Institute of Systems Science at the University of Linz during the years 1986–1993. The first version of CAST.FSM was implemented in INTERLISP-D and LOOPS for the Siemens-Xerox workstation 5815 (“Dandelion”). CAST.FSM supports the application of the theory of finite state machines for hardware design tasks between the architecture level and the level of gate circuits. The application domain, to get practical experience for CAST.FSM, was the field of VLSI design of ASICS’s where the theory of finite state machines can be applied to improve the testability of such circuits (“design for testability”) and to optimise the required silicon area of the circuit (“floor planning”). An overview of CAST as a whole and of CAST.FSM as a CAST tool is given in [11]. In our presentation we want to report on the re-engineering of CAST.FSM and on new types of applications of CAST.FSM which are currently under investigation. In this context we will distinguish between three different problems:\n1.\nthe implementation of CAST.FSM in ANSI Common Lisp and the design of a new user interface by Rudolf Mittelmann [5].\n\n \n2.\nthe search for systemstheoretical concepts in modelling intelligent hierarchical systems based on the past work of Arthur Koestler [3] following the concepts presented by Franz Pichler in [10].\n\n \n3.\nthe construction of hierarchical formal models (of multi-layer type) to study attributes which are assumed for SOHO-structures (SOHO = Self Organizing Hierarchical Order) of A. Koestler.\n\n \nThe latter problem will deserve the main attention in our presentation. In the present paper we will build such a hierarchical model following the concepts of parallel decomposition of finite state machines (FSMs) and interpret it as a multi-layer type of model.",

      "abstract": "The Dipmeter Advisor was an early expert system developed in the 1980s by Schlumberger  with the help of artificial-intelligence workers at MIT to aid in the analysis of data gathered during oil exploration. The Advisor was generally not merely an inference engine and a knowledge base of ~90 rules, but generally was a full-fledged workstation, running on one of Xerox's 1100 Dolphin Lisp machines (or in general on Xerox's \"1100 Series Scientific Information Processors\" line) and written in INTERLISP-D, with a pattern recognition layer which in turn fed a GUI menu-driven interface. It was developed by a number of people, including Reid G. Smith, James D. Baker, and Robert L. Young.It was primarily influential not because of any great technical leaps, but rather because it was so successful for Schlumberger's oil divisions and because it was one of the few success stories of the AI bubble to receive wide publicity before the AI winter.\nThe AI rules of the Dipmeter Advisor were primarily derived from Al Gilreath, a Schlumberger interpretation engineer who developed the \"red, green, blue\" pattern method of dipmeter interpretation.\nUnfortunately this method had limited application in more complex geological environments outside the Gulf Coast, and the Dipmeter Advisor was primarily used within Schlumberger as a graphical display tool to assist interpretation by trained geoscientists, rather than as an AI tool for use by novice interpreters. However, the tool pioneered a new approach to workstation-assisted graphical interpretation of geological information.",

Emulation is a type of virtualization that re-creates the conditions for a piece of legacy software to operate on a modern system. The paper first offers a review of Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and Science and Technology Studies (STS) literature engaging with software as historical and sociotechnical artifacts, and with emulation as a vehicle of scholarly inquiry. It then documents the novel use of software emulations as a pedagogical resource and research tool for legacy software systems analysis. This is accomplished through the integration of the Emulation as a Service Infrastructure (EaaSI) distributed emulation network into a university-level course focusing on computer-aided design (CAD). The paper offers a detailed case study of a pedagogical experience oriented to incorporate emulations into software research and learning. It shows how emulations allow for close, user-centered analyses of software systems that highlight both their historical evolution and core interaction concepts, and how they shape the work practices of their users.",
