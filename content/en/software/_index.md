This section contains information on installing or setting up Medley and using it.

There are two main ways of running Medley: accessing it online in a web browser or installing and running the system on your computer. Online access is best for trying out Medley without installing anything, as well as for basic usage. Install the system on your computer if you want to run Medley offline, customize the environment, or simplify the exchange of files with Medley.

We are working on making an early version of Medley run in the browser. This example of software preservation will let you access a technology artifact of historical significance.

These are the available options for running Medley:
