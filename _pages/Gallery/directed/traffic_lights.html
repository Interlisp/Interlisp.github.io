"I played some days with making an interface between our ConceptBase system (essentially a database system to store models) and graphviz. One example graph is attached. It is a so-called petri net for Dutch traffic lights. The example is actually taken from a book by Wil van der Aalst." Contributed by Manfred Jeusfeld.
