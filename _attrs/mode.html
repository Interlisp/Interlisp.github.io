Technique for optimizing the layout. For neato, if <B>mode</B> is <TT>"major"</TT>,
neato uses stress majorization. If <B>mode</B> is <TT>"KK"</TT>,
neato uses a version of the gradient descent method. The only advantage
to the latter technique is that it is sometimes appreciably faster for
small (number of nodes &lt; 100) graphs. A significant disadvantage is that
it may cycle. If <B>mode</B> is <TT>"sgd"</TT>, neato uses a version of the
stochastic gradient descent method. The advantage of sgd is faster and more
reliable convergence than both the previous methods, while the disadvantage
is that it runs in a fixed number of iterations and may require larger
values of <TT>"maxiter"</TT> in some graphs.
<P>
There are two experimental modes in neato, "hier", which adds a top-down
directionality similar to the layout used in dot, and "ipsep", which
allows the graph to specify minimum vertical and horizontal distances
between nodes. (See the <A HREF=#d:sep>sep</A> attribute.)
<P>
For sfdp, the default <B>mode</B> is <TT>"spring"</TT>, which corresponds to using
a spring-electrical model. Setting <B>mode</B> to <TT>"maxent"</TT> causes a similar
model to be run but one that also takes into account edge lengths specified by the
<TT>"len"</TT> attribute.
