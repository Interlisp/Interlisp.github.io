Allows the graph author to provide an identifier for graph objects which is
to be included in the output.

Normal `\N`, `\E`, `\G` substitutions are applied.

If provided, it is the responsibility of the provider to keep
`id` values unique for its intended downstream use.

Note, in particular, that `\E` does not provide a unique id for multi-edges.

If no `id` attribute is provided, then a unique internal id is used. However, 
this value is unpredictable by the graph writer.

If the graph provides an `id` attribute, this will be used as a prefix for
internally generated attributes. By making internally-used attributes
distinct, the user can include multiple image maps in the same document.
