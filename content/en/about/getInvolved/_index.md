## GitHub

The [Interlisp](https://github.com/Interlisp) organization on GitHub contains re;ositories for the main [Medley](https://github.com/Interlisp/medley) Lisp code, build scripts and GitHub automation, the C-coded virtual machine, called [maiko](https://github.com/Interlisp/maiko), and documentation (including [this web site](https://github.com/Interlisp/Interlisp.github.io). 

Bugs, feature requests, and questions are best posted as [GitHub issues in the Medley repository](https://github.com/Interlisp/medley/issues). Do check to see if your issue or question is answered there.

Participants in the project can join the [GitHub Interlisp organization](https://github.com/orgs/Interlisp/people).

## Meetings

We have a weekly meeting on Mondays on Zoom. Meetings are to report accomplishments, status,  plans, and problems, and discuss directions. Meetings are recorded, but recordings are not public, If you'd like to join in, [let us know](mailto:info@interlisp.org).

_Monday, 1:00 pm ET / 10:00 am PT_ 

### Meeting Agendas and Notes

* In progress  -- we were collecting agendas on [the medley wiki](https://github.com/Interlisp/medley/wiki/). We're trying Google docs linked from the calendar invite for distributing meeting agendas and taking notes. For now meeting recordings are on Google Drive, but it's likely that we'll switch to "private" YouTube for holding meeting recordings.

## EMail and access groups

There are two Google groups in use: [Interlisp](mailto:interlisp@googlegroups.com), archives [here](https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/interlisp), and [LispCore](mailto:lispcore@googlegroups.com), archives [here](https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/lispcore). The archives are public. The LispCore group has access to meeting recordings, and usually gets more email (at least lately).

* The email alias [info@interlisp.org](mailto:info@interlisp.org) is monitored for those using Lisp.

* Interlisp.org is a Google workspace; "interlisp.org" email addresses and aliases are available.

* [InterlispOrg Inc](../partners/interlisporg-inc/) is a non-profit 501c3 corporation. We accept donations.
