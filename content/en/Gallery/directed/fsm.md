This is a drawing of a toy [parser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LR_parser)
finite automaton, probably generated by
[Yacc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacc).

The `rankdir=LR` attribute requests a left-to-right drawing, oriented in
landscape mode. Note the use of text labels on edges.

Computation begins at node `0`, and ends at "accept state" nodes, marked with
double-circles.
