Specifies the name of the layout algorithm to use, such as "dot"
or "neato". Normally, graphs should be kept independent of a type of
layout. In some cases, however, it can be convenient to embed the type
of layout desired within the graph. For example, a graph containing
position information from a layout might want to record what the
associated layout algorithm was.
