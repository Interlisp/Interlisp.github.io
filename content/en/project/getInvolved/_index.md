There several ways to get involved in the Medley Interlisp Project, depending on your background and interests. These are elaborated below:

1. [Try it!](/software) We've tried to make it easy.
2. Look at, comment on, and contribute to Interlisp on GitHub.
3. Join in the discussions through a variety of interfaces.
4. Participate in weekly meetings; Read meeting agendas and notes.
5. Propose a project you want to take on, with help and guidance from us.
6. [Donate](/project/donate).

## 1. Try it!

We're actively trying to improve the new user experience, but don't expect a polished commercial product--we're still in the middle of restoration. But things are pretty stable. [online.interlisp.org](https://online.interlisp.org) should get you started. Type in (+ 1 2 3).

## 2. GitHub

We work primarily through [the Interlisp repositories on GitHub](https://github.com/Interlisp). While there are several repositories for the project, issues (problem reports) are to be found in the [medley repo issue list](https://github.com/Interlisp/medley/issues). If you have a GitHub account, you can watch the repositories of interest (medley, maiko, online).

Bug reports, feature requests, documentation problems, and questions are posted as [GitHub issues in the Medley repository](https://github.com/Interlisp/medley/issues). Do check to see if your issue or question is answered there first.

* [Medley](https://github.com/Interlisp/medley): Lisp code, build scripts and GitHub automation
* [maiko](https://github.com/Interlisp/maiko): The C-coded virtual machine
* [this web site](https://github.com/Interlisp/Interlisp.github.io#README)

## 3. Join in the discussions

### Discussion board

The [discussion board on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/Interlisp/discussions) is for general discussions and questions on the Medley environment, the Interlisp language, and Lisp development on the Medley system.

### EMail

There are two Google groups (mailing lists):

* [Interlisp](mailto:interlisp@googlegroups.com), archives [here](https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/interlisp), and
* [LispCore](mailto:lispcore@googlegroups.com), archives [here](https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/lispcore).

The archives are public. The LispCore group gets much more email, and posts from non-members are moderated.

* Interlisp.org is a Google workspace; [let us know](mailto:info@interlisp.org) if you want an "interlisp.org" email addresses and why you want it.

### Chat
