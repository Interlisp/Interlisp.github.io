If false, the edge is not used in ranking the nodes. For example,
in the graph
<PRE>
digraph G {
  a -> c;
  a -> b;
  b -> c [constraint=false];
}
</PRE>
the edge <CODE>b -> c</CODE> does not add a constraint during rank
assignment, so the only constraints are that a be above b and c,
yielding the graph:<BR>
