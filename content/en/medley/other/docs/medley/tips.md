## Get an Interlisp Exec (REPL)
Click and hold the right mouse button on the background, hover over EXEC, move to the right, go to "Interlisp", release the right mouse button.
## Increase the font size
In an Interlisp Exec, type one of the following:
```
(FONTSET 'BIGGER)
(FONTSET 'HUGE)
```
**New** windows and future lines in the Exec will now be in a larger font.
## Edit a function definition
To edit the definition of a function FOO, type into an Interlisp Exec:
```
(DF FOO)
```
This will let you draw out a new SEdit window, which you can use to edit the code.

Middle-click in the titlebar to get additional options.
