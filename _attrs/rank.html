Rank constraints on the nodes in a subgraph.
If <B>rank</B>="same", all nodes are placed on the same rank.
If <B>rank</B>="min", all nodes are placed on the minimum rank.
If <B>rank</B>="source", all nodes are placed on the minimum rank, and
the only nodes on the minimum rank belong to some subgraph whose
rank attribute is "source" or "min".
Analogous criteria hold for <B>rank</B>="max" and <B>rank</B>="sink".
(Note: the
minimum rank is topmost or leftmost, and the maximum rank is bottommost
or rightmost.)
