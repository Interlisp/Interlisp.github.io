## 3/2022

## 12/2021

* [Interlisp Online](https://online.interlisp.org): Run Medley Interlisp in the cloud with just a browser. No download or install. Lower the barrier to entry. Of course, it's better to install a release on your own machine, but for the casual visitor, this is better.
  * Still under development but try it out, report problems (use issue tag 'online').
  * There seem to be problems with Safari on older macs--try Firefox or Chrome.
  * a mouse and keyboard are still necessary on tablets.
  * For the immersive "Lisp Machine" experience, run "fullscreen".
  * HiRes display? Most browsers will let you scale the pixels.
* [InterlispOrg Inc](https://github.com/Interlisp/medley/wiki/InterlispOrg-Inc) has been approved as a 501c3 with the IRS. The simplest way to donate is using the GitHub Sponsor button.

## 11/2021

* [Medley Interlisp: Tools and Utilities](https://interlisp.org/documentation/2021-interlisp-book-3.pdf) (Interlisp book 3) now available for preview; comments and corrections welcome.
* [2021 Annual Report](/project/status/2021medleyannualreport), November 15, 2021.
