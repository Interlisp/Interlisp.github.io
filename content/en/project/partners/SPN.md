The Medley Interlisp Project has joined (as an "implementation sponsor") the [Software Preservation Network](https://www.softwarepreservationnetwork.org/). SPN is a coordinated, distributed effort to ensure long term access to software through community engagement, infrastructure support and knowledge generation. See [Interlisp and SPN](https://www.softwarepreservationnetwork.org/Interlisp/) for more information.

SPN is hosted by the [Educopia Institute](https://educopia.org).

They recommended the following resources:

* [Community Cultivation Framework](https://educopia.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CommunityCultivationFieldGuide.pdf): a framework for thinking through a community's development.
* [Vision in Formation](https://educopia.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vision-in-Formation_-_Articulating-Your-Communitys-Purpose_-Facilitators-Guide_v5.pdf): "Articulating Your Community's Purpose": A community facilitator's guide around starting those mission, vision, and values statements, with templates, including sample agendas, forms, and boilerplate email text.
* ["It Takes a Village"](https://itav.lyrasis.org/): Tools for planning sustainability for open source software initiatives serving cultural and scientific heritage organizations.
* [The Community Tool Box](https://ctb.ku.edu/en): templates and advice around community assessment, developing strategic plans and organizational structure, and building community.
