Only valid when <A HREF=#d:mode>mode</A>="ipsep".
If true, constraints are generated for each edge in the largest (heuristic)
directed acyclic subgraph such that the edge must point downwards.
If "hier", generates level constraints similar to those used with
<A HREF=#d:mode>mode</A>="hier". The main difference is that, in the latter
case, only these constraints are involved, so a faster solver can be used.
