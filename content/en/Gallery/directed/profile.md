This is the dynamic profile of a sort program,
generated from the `gprof` tool.  Nodes represent
functions and edges represent function calls.
They are colored according to gprof's estimate
of the time spent within a given function and
the time charged to a given call site.
The colors are encoded as hue-saturation-brightness
triples.  We have found it advantageous to vary both
hue and saturation to draw attention to hot spots,
rather than present a baffling rainbow of colors.
