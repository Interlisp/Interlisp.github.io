This value specifies how the distance matrix is computed for the input
graph. The distance matrix specifies the ideal distance between every
pair of nodes. neato attemps to find a layout which best achieves
these distances. By default, it uses the length of the shortest path,
where the length of each edge is given by its <A HREF=#d:len>len</A>
attribute. If <B>model</B> is <TT>"circuit"</TT>, neato uses the
circuit resistance
model to compute the distances. This tends to emphasize clusters. If
<B>model</B> is <TT>"subset"</TT>, neato uses the subset model. This sets the
edge length to be the number of nodes that are neighbors of exactly one
of the end points, and then calculates the shortest paths. This helps
to separate nodes with high degree.
<P>
For more control of distances, one can use <TT>model=mds</TT>. In this
case, the <A HREF=#d:len>len</A> of an edge is used as the ideal distance
between its vertices. A shortest path calculation is only used for
pairs of nodes not connected by an edge. Thus, by supplying a complete
graph, the input can specify all of the relevant distances.
