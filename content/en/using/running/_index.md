You can run Medley Interlisp on a wide variety of systems.  This section lays out the basics to help you choose:

* [Interlisp Online](online)
  * for most systems; see caveats
* [In a Docker container](running-with-docker)
  * currently windows x86_64 only
* Download and install from a release
  * [Running on Mac](running-on-mac)
  (Is this active or still in progress? If it is not ready, I do not think we should not have it listed.)
  * [Running on Windows](runnning-on-win)
     * For Windows 10 or 11 with WSL1 or WSL2 
     (is this really different from running in a Docker container? Should they be combined under a single topic?)
  * [Running on Linux](running-on-linux)

For other OS or machine architectures, You can (re)build the virtual machine emulator (Maiko) from sources, and then run in a release or even build your own images (sysouts).

(Where does the link to the build topics fit into these pages?)

See README.md files in the GitHub repo.
