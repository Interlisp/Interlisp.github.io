  <h1>The Interlisp Revival</h1>
</header>

<p>Welcome to the start of a new chapter in computing! We're a group of software developers making the Medley Interlisp system available for use on modern computer systems.</p>

<p>The Medley system was created at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). PARC was the cradle of the modern graphical user interface and its design thinking continued with the development of Medley Interlisp, an extensible graphical operating system with nearly limitless possibilities for customization. Whatever the task, using Medley you can design a custom workflow to help accomplish it.</p>

<p>Interlisp was first released by Xerox and distributed commercially until its development ceased in the 1990s. Until 2009 it survived only in the hands of a few of the original developers, but now this classic software system is running again on your favorite operating system. This project is more than a trip down memory lane: our mission is to expand the scope of what Medley can do, fulfilling its promise of software tools limited only by the user's imagination. Dive in and explore the language, the tools, and the myriad applications, experiments, and playful creations that were crafted in and for Interlisp.</p>

<!--
<p>Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) is remembered mainly as the birthplace of the modern graphical user interface, influencing the development of the graphical operating systems we know today. At the same time PARC did pioneering work in the field of AI using a language called Interlisp. This powerful programmable language became the basis of Medley, a graphical software environment that carried on the design thinking of PARC's original Alto interface.</p>

<p>Medley's life as a commercial product ended in the 1990s, and until 2009 its source code only remained in the hands of the development team. Now the system is running again on modern computer systems, thanks to the combined efforts of original developers and interested newcomers. Our goal is to revive Interlisp in language, environment and spirit through the Medley Interlisp Project.</p>
