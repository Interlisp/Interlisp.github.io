Set the number of dimensions used for rendering. 
The maximum value allowed is 10.
If both <TT>dimen</TT> and <TT>dim</TT> are set, the latter specifies
the dimension used for layout, and the former for rendering.
If only <TT>dimen</TT> is set, this is used for both layout and rendering
dimensions.
<P>
Note that, at present, all aspects of rendering are 2D. This includes
the shape and size of nodes, overlap removal, and edge routing. Thus,
for <TT>dimen &gt; 2</TT>, the only valid information is the <TT>pos</TT>
attribute of the nodes.
All other coordinates will be 2D and, at best, will reflect a projection
of a higher-dimensional point onto the plane.
