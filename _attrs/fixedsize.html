If <tt>false</tt>, the size of a node is determined by smallest width and height
needed to contain its label and image, if any, with a margin specified by
the <A HREF=#d:margin><TT>margin</TT></A> attribute. The width
and height must also be at least as large as the sizes specified by the
<A HREF=#d:width><TT>width</TT></A> and
<A HREF=#d:height><TT>height</TT></A> attributes, which specify
the minimum values for these parameters. 
<P>
If <tt>true</tt>, the node size is specified by the values of the
<A HREF=#d:width><TT>width</TT></A>
and <A HREF=#d:height><TT>height</TT></A> attributes only
and is not expanded to contain the text label.
There will be a warning if the label (with margin)
cannot fit within these limits.
<P>
If the <A HREF=attrs.html#d:fixedsize><TT>fixedsize</TT></A> attribute is set 
to <tt>shape</tt>, the <A HREF=#d:width><TT>width</TT></A> and
<A HREF=#d:height><TT>height</TT></A> attributes also determine the size
of the node shape, but the label can be much larger. Both the label and
shape sizes are used when avoiding node overlap, but all edges to the
node ignore the label and only contact the node shape. No warning is given
if the label is too large.
