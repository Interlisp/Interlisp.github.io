`sfdp` stands for Scalable Force Directed Placement.

`sfdp` is a fast, multilevel, force-directed algorithm that efficiently layouts large graphs, based on the ["Efficient and High Quality Force-Dircted Graph Drawing"](http://yifanhu.net/PUB/graph_draw_small.pdf) paper.

Multiscale version of `fdp` for the layout of large graphs.
