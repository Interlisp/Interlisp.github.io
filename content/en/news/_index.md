# Recent Updates
## 6/2022
 - Documentation update. We're updating the project documentation. Feel free to make suggestions for improvement
 - Significant development of integration with GitHub (via the GITFNS module) for doing a Lisp-based PR review workflow.
## 3/2022
 - [Interlisp Online](https://online.interlisp.org) new version! Many new/improved features. From any (recent) browser. Medley is running "in the cloud" and you connect to it (and your account) over the web.  
 - Medley [Documentation](https://github.com/Interlisp/medley/wiki/Documentation). We've been updating the online documentation at least for getting started -- instructions on Running in various contexts and Building and Using.
 - Interlisp.Org has been approved as tax-exempt by California Franchise Tax Board and the California AG, State Charity Registration Number: [CT0278267](https://rct.doj.ca.gov/Verification/Web/Search.aspx?facility=Y)
 - We have joined (as an "implementation sponsor") the [Software Preservation Network](https://www.softwarepreservationnetwork.org/). See [Interlisp and SPN](https://www.softwarepreservationnetwork.org/Interlisp/) for more information.
 - Many updates to Medley features and files; most [releases](https://github.com/Interlisp/medley/releases) have a 'What's Changed' section or URL.

* Joining the Software Preservation Network.
* Interlisp.online progress, changes expected

* work on Lisp-based GitHub client, comparison of Lisp files

## 12/2021

* [Interlisp Online](https://online.interlisp.org): Run Medley Interlisp in the cloud with just a browser. No download or install. Lower the barrier to entry. Of course, it's better to install a release on your own machine, but for the casual visitor, this is better. 
   * Still under development but try it out, report problems (use issue tag 'online'). 
   * There seem to be problems with Safari on older macs--try Firefox or Chrome.
   * a mouse and keyboard are still necessary on tablets.
   * For the immersive "Lisp Machine" experience, run "fullscreen".
   * HiRes display? Most browsers will let you scale the pixels.
* [InterlispOrg Inc](https://github.com/Interlisp/medley/wiki/InterlispOrg-Inc) has been approved as a 501c3 with the IRS. The simplest way to donate is using the GitHub Sponsor button.
* recent reviews [on twitter](https://twitter.com/ftrain/status/1470968024756895744) were complimentary of our efforts
