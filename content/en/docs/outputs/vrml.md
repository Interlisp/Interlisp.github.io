Outputs graphs in the [VRML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VRML) format.
To get a 3D embedding, nodes must have a [`z`](attrs.html#d:z)
attribute. These can either be supplied as part of the input graph, or
be generated by neato provided <code>[dim](attrs.html#d:dim)=3</code>
and at least one node has a `z` value.

Line segments are drawn as cylinders.
In general, VRML output relies on having the PNG library to produce images
used to texture-fill the node shapes. However, if
<code>[shape](attrs.html#d:shape)=point</code>,
a node is drawn as a 3D sphere.
