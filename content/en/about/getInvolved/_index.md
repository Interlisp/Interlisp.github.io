## Meetings

We have a weekly meeting on Mondays on Zoom. Meetings are to report accomplishments, status, plans, and problems, and discuss directions. Meetings are recorded, but recordings are not public, If you'd like to join in, [let us know](mailto:info@interlisp.org).

_Monday, 1:30 pm ET / 10:30 am PT_

### Meeting Agendas and Notes

Meeting recordings are made using Zoom "record to the cloud" and then download to google drive; but saving to a youtube private channel is a possibility.

## EMail and access groups

There are two Google groups in use:
