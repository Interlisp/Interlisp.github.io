Maximum width and height of drawing, in inches.
If only a single number is given, this is used for both the width
and the height.
<P>
If defined and the drawing is larger than the given size, 
the drawing is uniformly
scaled down so that it fits within the given size.
<P>
If <TT>size</TT> ends in an exclamation point (<TT>!</TT>),
then it is taken to be
the desired size. In this case, if both dimensions of the drawing are
less than <TT>size</TT>, the drawing is scaled up uniformly until at
least one dimension equals its dimension in <TT>size</TT>.
<P>
Note that there is some interaction between the <B>size</B> and
<A HREF=#d:ratio><B>ratio</B></A> attributes.
