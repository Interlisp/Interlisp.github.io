Determines if and how node overlaps should be removed. Nodes are first
enlarged using the <A HREF=#d:sep><B>sep</B></A> attribute.
If "true" , overlaps are retained.
If the value is "scale", overlaps are removed by uniformly scaling in x and y.
If the value converts to "false", and it is available, Prism, a proximity graph-based algorithm, is
used to remove node overlaps.
This can also be invoked explicitly with "overlap=prism".
This technique starts with a
small scaling up, controlled by the 
<A HREF="#d:overlap_scaling"><TT>overlap_scaling</TT></A> attribute,
which can remove a significant portion of the overlap.
The prism option also accepts an optional non-negative integer suffix.
This can be used to control the number of attempts made at overlap
removal. By default, <TT>overlap="prism"</TT> is equivalent to
<TT>overlap="prism1000"</TT>. Setting <TT>overlap="prism0"</TT>
causes only the scaling phase to be run.
<P>
If Prism is not available, or the version of Graphviz is earlier than 2.28, "overlap=false"
uses a Voronoi-based technique.
This can always be invoked explicitly with "overlap=voronoi".
<P>
If the value is "scalexy", x and y are separately
scaled to remove overlaps.
<P>
If the value is "compress", the layout will be scaled down as much as
possible without introducing any overlaps, obviously assuming there are
none to begin with.
<P>
<B>N.B.</B>The remaining allowed values of <TT>overlap</TT>
correspond to algorithms which, at present, can produce bad aspect ratios.
In addition, we deprecate the use of the "ortho*" and "portho*".
<P>
If the value is "vpsc", overlap removal is done as a
quadratic optimization to minimize node displacement while removing
node overlaps.
<P>
If the value is "orthoxy" or "orthoyx", overlaps
are moved by optimizing two constraint problems, one for the x axis and
one for the y. The suffix indicates which axis is processed first.
If the value is "ortho", the technique is similar to "orthoxy" except a
heuristic is used to reduce the bias between the two passes.
If the value is "ortho_yx", the technique is the same as "ortho", except
the roles of x and y are reversed.
The values "portho", "porthoxy", "porthoxy", and "portho_yx" are similar
to the previous four, except only pseudo-orthogonal ordering is
enforced.
<P>
If the layout is done by neato with <A HREF=#d:mode>mode</A>="ipsep",
then one can use <TT>overlap=ipsep</TT>.
In this case, the overlap removal constraints are
incorporated into the layout algorithm itself.
N.B. At present, this only supports one level of clustering.
<P>
Except for fdp and sfdp, the layouts assume <TT>overlap="true"</TT> as the default.
Fdp first uses a number of passes using a built-in, force-directed technique
to try to remove overlaps. Thus, fdp accepts <B>overlap</B> with an integer
prefix followed by a colon, specifying the number of tries. If there is
no prefix, no initial tries will be performed. If there is nothing following
a colon, none of the above methods will be attempted. By default, fdp
uses <TT>overlap="9:prism"</TT>. Note that <TT>overlap="true"</TT>,
<TT>overlap="0:true"</TT> and <TT>overlap="0:"</TT> all turn off all overlap
removal.
<P>
By default, sfdp uses <TT>overlap="prism0"</TT>.
<P>
Except for the Voronoi and prism methods, all of these transforms preserve the
orthogonal ordering of the original layout. That is, if the x coordinates
of two nodes are originally the same, they will remain the same, and if
the x coordinate of one node is originally less than the x coordinate of
another, this relation will still hold in the transformed layout. The
similar properties hold for the y coordinates.
This is not quite true for the "porth*" cases. For these, orthogonal
ordering is only preserved among nodes related by an edge.
