Specifies margin to leave around nodes when removing node overlap.
This guarantees a minimal non-zero distance between nodes.
<P>
If the attribute begins with a plus sign '+', an additive margin is
specified. That is, "+w,h" causes the node's bounding box to be increased 
by w
points on the left and right sides, and by h points on the top and bottom.
Without a plus sign, the node is scaled by 1 + w in the x coordinate
and 1 + h in the y coordinate.
<P>
If only a single number is given, this is used for both dimensions.
<P>
If unset but <A HREF=#d:esep>esep</A> is defined, the <tt>sep</tt> values
will be set to the <tt>esep</tt> values divided by <tt>0.8</tt>. 
If <tt>esep</tt> is unset, the default value is used.
