Danny Bobrow was a fundamental architect of the Interlisp environment, overseeing its evolution from its origins as BBN-LISP to a premier AI development platform at Xerox PARC.

**Impact:**

Beginning in 1966 at BBN, Bobrow co-implemented Lisp for the PDP-1 and later the SDS 940, where he pioneered the use of "two-level storage" and paging systems to overcome small physical memory limits. In 1970, he co-designed the innovative "spaghetti stack" to handle complex control structures. Upon moving to Xerox PARC in 1973, he helped rebrand the system as Interlisp, fostering a highly collaborative environment that integrated radical tools like the DWIM (Do-What-I-Mean) error corrector and the Masterscope program analyzer. His leadership at PARC expanded the system's capabilities into object-oriented programming with LOOPS and the Metaobject Protocol, work that eventually earned him and his team the 1992 ACM Software System Award for creating a pioneering integrated development environment (IDE).
