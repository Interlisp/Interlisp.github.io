Width and height of output pages, in inches. If only a single value
is given, this is used for both the width and height.
<P>
If this is set and is
smaller than the size of the layout, a rectangular array of pages of
the specified page size is overlaid on the layout, with origins
aligned in the lower-left corner, thereby partitioning the layout
into pages. The pages are then produced one at a time, in
<A HREF=#d:pagedir>pagedir</A> order.
<P>
At present, this only works for PostScript output. For other types of
output, one should use another tool to split the output into multiple
output files. Or use the <A HREF=#d:viewport>viewport</A> to generate
multiple files.
