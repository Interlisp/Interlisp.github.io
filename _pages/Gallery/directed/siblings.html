This is a graphviz-produced layout of the "family tree" of a fraternity and sorority.

Each member in the graph was assigned a "big brother" from one organization and a "big sister" from the other. Blue icons represent Brothers from the fraternity, Pink represents Sisters from the sorority (Purple members are in both organizations - like honoraries.)

Charter members (who can have no parent nodes) are outlined.
