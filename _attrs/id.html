Allows the graph author to provide an id for graph objects which is to be included in the output.
Normal "&#92;N", "&#92;E", "&#92;G" substitutions are applied.
If provided, it is the responsibility of the provider to keep
its values sufficiently unique for its intended downstream use.
Note, in particular, that "&#92;E" does not provide a unique id for multi-edges.
If no id attribute is provided, then a unique internal id is used. However, 
this value is unpredictable by the graph writer.
An externally provided id is not used internally.
<P>
If the graph provides an id attribute, this will be used as a prefix for
internally generated attributes. By making these distinct, the user
can include multiple image maps in the same document.
