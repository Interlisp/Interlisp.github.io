## Welcome to the Medley Interlisp Experience

The [Medley Interlisp Project](/project) has focused on bringing this [historical software](/history) to life. This section contains information on setting up the Medley system and using it.

There are two main ways of running Medley: accessing it online in a web browser or installing and running the system on your computer. Online access is good for trying out Medley without installing anything, as well as for basic usage. Install the system on your computer if you want to run Medley offline, customize the environment, and have direct access to local files.

* [Access Medley Online](access-online): how to access Medley running on our servers using your web browser. 
* [Install and Run](install-and-run): how to set Medley up on your computer, and (re)start each time.

Once you are up and running, see "[Using Medley](using-medley)" for some basics and pointers to other documentation.

* [Run Medley in the browser](http://wasm.interlisp.org/medley.html)

We are making an earlier version of Interlisp-D run in the browser, an example of software preservation that lets you access a technology artifact of historical significance.

This experimental port is based on a version of the Maiko virtual machine compiled to WebAssembly with Emscripten. It currently doesn't support a file system and **can't save files**. To end a session just close the browser tab.
