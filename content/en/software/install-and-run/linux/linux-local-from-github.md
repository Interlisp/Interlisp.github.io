3. Choose the release you are interested in (most likely the release marked ***Latest***) and click on the arrow next the word ***Assets*** to reveal the list of assets (i.e., installation files) for that release.   

4. To download the .tgz install file, click on the link that ends with ***.tgz*** and begins with either ***medley-full-linux-x86_64*** (if you are installing on an x86_64-based machine)  or ***medley-full-linux-aarch64*** (if you are installing on an Arm64-based machine) or  ***medley-full-linux-arm7l*** (if you are installing on an Arm7-based machine - e.g., a Raspberry Pi).
