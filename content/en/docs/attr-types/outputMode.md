* `"breadthfirst"`
* `"nodesfirst"`
* `"edgesfirst"`

These specify the order in which nodes and edges are drawn in concrete
output.

* The default `"breadthfirst"` is the simplest, but when the graph
layout does not avoid edge-node overlap, this mode will sometimes have
edges drawn over nodes and sometimes on top of nodes.

* If the mode `"nodesfirst"` is chosen, all nodes are drawn first, followed by the
edges. This guarantees an edge-node overlap will not be mistaken for
an edge ending at a node.

* On the other hand, usually for aesthetic
reasons, it may be desirable that all edges appear beneath nodes, even
if the resulting drawing is ambiguous. This can be achieved by choosing
`"edgesfirst"`.
