Determines if and how node overlaps should be removed.

Nodes are first
enlarged using the [`sep`](#d:sep) attribute. If `true` , overlaps are
retained. If the value is `"scale"`, overlaps are removed by uniformly scaling
in x and y. If the value converts to `"false"`, and it is available, Prism, a
proximity graph-based algorithm, is used to remove node overlaps. This can
also be invoked explicitly with `overlap=prism`. This technique starts with a
small scaling up, controlled by the [`overlap_scaling`](#d:overlap_scaling)
attribute, which can remove a significant portion of the overlap. The prism
option also accepts an optional non-negative integer suffix. This can be used
to control the number of attempts made at overlap removal. By default,
`overlap="prism"` is equivalent to `overlap="prism1000"`. Setting
`overlap="prism0"` causes only the scaling phase to be run.

If Prism is not available, or the version of Graphviz is earlier than 2.28,
`"overlap=false"` uses a Voronoi-based technique. This can always be invoked
explicitly with `"overlap=voronoi"`.

If `overlap="scalexy"`, x and y are separately scaled to remove overlaps.

If `overlay="compress"`, the layout will be scaled down as much as
possible without introducing any overlaps, obviously assuming there are none
to begin with.

**N.B.**The remaining allowed values of `overlap` correspond to algorithms which, at present, can produce bad aspect ratios. In addition, we deprecate the use of the `"ortho*"` and `"portho*"`.

If the value is `"vpsc"`, overlap removal is done as a quadratic optimization
to minimize node displacement while removing node overlaps.

If the value is `"orthoxy"` or `"orthoyx"`, overlaps are moved by optimizing two
constraint problems, one for the x axis and one for the y. The suffix
indicates which axis is processed first. If the value is "ortho", the
technique is similar to "orthoxy" except a heuristic is used to reduce the
bias between the two passes. If the value is `"ortho_yx"`, the technique is
the same as `"ortho"`, except the roles of x and y are reversed. The values
`"portho"`, `"porthoxy"`, `"porthoxy"`, and `"portho_yx"` are similar to the
previous four, except only pseudo-orthogonal ordering is enforced.

If the layout is done by neato with [`mode`](#d:mode)`="ipsep"`, then one can use
`overlap=ipsep`. In this case, the overlap removal constraints are
incorporated into the layout algorithm itself. N.B. At present, this only
supports one level of clustering.

Except for `fdp` and `sfdp`, the layouts assume `overlap="true"` as the default.
Fdp first uses a number of passes using a built-in, force-directed technique
to try to remove overlaps. Thus, `fdp` accepts `overlap` with an integer
prefix followed by a colon, specifying the number of tries. If there is no
prefix, no initial tries will be performed. If there is nothing following a
colon, none of the above methods will be attempted. By default, `fdp` uses
`overlap="9:prism"`. Note that `overlap="true"`, `overlap="0:true"` and
`overlap="0:"` all turn off all overlap removal.

By default, `sfdp` uses `overlap="prism0"`.

Except for the Voronoi and prism methods, all of these transforms preserve
the orthogonal ordering of the original layout. That is, if the x coordinates
of two nodes are originally the same, they will remain the same, and if the x
coordinate of one node is originally less than the x coordinate of another,
this relation will still hold in the transformed layout. The similar
properties hold for the y coordinates. This is not quite true for the
`"porth*"` cases. For these, orthogonal ordering is only preserved among nodes
related by an edge.
