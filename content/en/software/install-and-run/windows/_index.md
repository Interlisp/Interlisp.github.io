There are two ways to install and run Medley on Windows. These two ways result in (nearly) identical Medley experiences, but differ in how Medley is installed and started.

1. [Using WSL](wsl) (Windows Syswem for Linux). Medley on WSL requires the WSL subsystem to be installed on your Windows system. And when installing and using Medley on WSL you are working within a Linux environment. Some familiarity with Linux and the Linux command line is helpful.  Medley on WSL is best for users who are running WSL anyway and/or prefer working in a Linux environment.

2. [Run Medley 'native'](native). Medley 'native' works within the ordinary Windows environment. Installation uses a standard Windows installer and you start Medley from a standard Command (or Powershell) window.  Medley 'native' is best for users who prefer to stay (almost) exclusively in the Windows environment.
 
Medley on WSL and 'native' Medley both require 64-bit Windows 10/11.
