name: shape
---
A string specifying the <A HREF=shapes.html>shape</A> of a node.
There are three
main types of shapes :
<A HREF=shapes.html#polygon>polygon-based</A>,
<A HREF=shapes.html#record>record-based</A> and
<A HREF=shapes.html#epsf>user-defined</A>.
The record-based shape has largely been superseded and greatly generalized
by <A HREF=shapes.html#html>HTML-like labels</A>. 
That is, instead of using <TT>shape=record</TT>, one might
consider using <TT>shape=none</TT> and an HTML-like label.
