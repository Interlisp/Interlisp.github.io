We have incorporated as a non-profit corporation in California.

We have been approved by the IRS for 501(c)3 status, and have applied to the California FTB for tax-free status. We have an EIN number assigned. We have a bank account. We can accept donations that may be tax-deductable for the donor. The simplest way to do so is using the GitHub Sponsor mechanism.

The name of the organization is "InterlispOrg Inc" (no punctuation).
The board of directors met and, among other things, approved bylaws.
It is not a membership organization.

There are three directors:
* Larry Masinter (President)
* Ron Kaplan (Treasurer)
* Herb Jellinek (Secretary)

The charitable purpose of the organization is Scientific and, in particular, Computer Science research.
The principal activity is to "develop demonstrations of software ideas based on Interlisp".

The reason for going through this rigamarole is to allow charitable donations that can be passed on to other 501c3 partner organizations (CHM, Stanford, UCSC, SPN) and if it works out, to hold the copyright and licenses.
