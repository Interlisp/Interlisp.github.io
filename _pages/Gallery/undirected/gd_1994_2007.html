This is a co-authorship graph. Each node is an author and an edge
exists between two authors if their names appear on a paper from one of
the International Symposia on Graph Drawing bewteeen 1994-2007. The
top 8 connected components are taken, and the graph is laid out using
sfdp. A map showing the clustering relationship is generated using
gvmap.

<p>

Note that input graph to gvmap must first be laid out, with overlap removed. E.g.,

<p>

sfdp -Goverlap=prism -Gcharset=latin1 gd_1994_2007_8comp.gv | gvmap  -e | neato -Ecolor="#55555522" -n2 -Tpng > gd_1994_2007_8comp.png

<p>
More information about the algorithm behind gvmap is found <a href="http://www2.research.att.com/~yifanhu/MAPS/index.html"> here</a>.
