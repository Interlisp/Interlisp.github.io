Packaged releases of Medley are available for Linux (most recent distros), macOS and Windows 10/11.  Both x86_64 and ARM64 systems are supported (as well as ARM7 - e.g., Raspberry Pi - for Linux).  Instructions for installing and running Medley on these platforms are linked below.

Medley is capable of running on a variety of other OSes including FreeBSD and Solaris, as well as on other CPU architectures including i386, SPARC, PowerPC, and RISC-V.  To install and run Medley on these platforms, you will need to build Medley (and, optionally, its underlying virtual machine, *Maiko*) from the sources available in the Interlisp repos on [GitHub.com](https://github.com/interlisp/).  Instructions for building Medley and Maiko can be found on GitHub in the [*README* for Maiko](https://github.com/interlisp/maiko) and the [*README* for Medley](https://github.com/interlisp/medley).

## Release Notes

Builds of Medley for several operating systems and architectures are generated automatically every week. You can [learn what's changed and download the latest builds](https://github.com/Interlisp/medley/releases). We advise caution as these builds are untested and may have bugs or other issues.
