Gives the name of a file containing an image to be displayed inside
a node. The image file must be in one of the recognized 
<A HREF=output.html#d:image_fmts>formats</A>,
typically JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, SVG or Postscript, and be able to be converted
into the desired output format.
<P>
The file must contain the image size information. This is usually trivially
true for the bitmap formats. For PostScript, the file must contain a
line starting with <TT>%%BoundingBox: </TT> followed by four integers
specifying the lower left x and y coordinates and the upper right x and y
coordinates of the bounding box for the image, the coordinates being in
points. An SVG image file must contain <TT>width</TT> and <TT>height</TT>
attributes, typically as part of the <TT>svg</TT> element.
The values for these should have the form of a floating point number,
followed by optional units, e.g., <TT>width="76pt"</TT>. 
Recognized units are <TT>in</TT>, <TT>px</TT>,
<TT>pc</TT>, <TT>pt</TT>, <TT>cm</TT> and <TT>mm</TT> for inches, pixels,
picas, points, centimeters and millimeters, respectively.
The default unit is points.
<P>
Unlike with the <A HREF=#d:shapefile>shapefile</A> attribute,
the image is treated as node
content rather than the entire node. In particular, an image can
be contained in a node of any shape, not just a rectangle.
