name: escString
---
A string allowing escape sequences which are replaced according
to the context.
For node attributes, the substring "&#92;N" is replaced by the name of the node,
and the substring "&#92;G" by the name of the graph.
For graph or cluster attributes, the substring "&#92;G" is replaced by the
name of the graph or cluster.
For edge attributes, the substring "&#92;E" is replaced by the name of the edge,
the substring "&#92;G" is replaced by the name of the graph or cluster,
and the substrings "&#92;T" and "&#92;H" by the names of
the tail and head nodes, respectively.
The name of an edge is the string formed from the name of the
tail node, the appropriate edge operator ("--" or "->") and the name of the
head node.
In all cases, the substring "&#92;L" is replaced by the object's label attribute.
<P>
In addition, if the associated attribute is
<A HREF=#a:label>label</A>,
<A HREF=#a:headlabel>headlabel</A> or <A HREF=#a:taillabel>taillabel</A>,
the escape sequences "&#92;n", "&#92;l" and "&#92;r"
divide the label into lines, centered, left-justified, and right-justified,
respectively.
<P>
Obviously, one can use "&#92;&#92;" to get a single backslash. A backslash appearing before any
character not listed above is ignored.
