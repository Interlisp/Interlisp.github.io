There several ways to get involved in the Medley Interlisp Project, depending on your background and interests.

1. If you know a little Lisp, [Try it!](/software) We've tried to make it easy. 
2. Look at, comment on, and contribute to Interlisp on GitHub.
3. Join in the discussions through a variety of interfaces.
4. Participate in weekly meetings; Read meeting agendas and notes.
5. Propose a project you want to take on, with help and guidance from us.
6. [Send us a donation.](https://github.com/sponsors/Interlisp)

## 1. Try it!

We're actively trying to improve the new user experience, but don't expect a polished commercial product. We're still in the middle of restoration. But things are pretty stable, even so. [online.interlisp.org](https://online.interlisp.org) should get you started. Type in (+ 1 2 3).

## 2. GitHub

We work primarily through [the Interlisp repository on GitHub](https://github.com/Interlisp). While there are several repositories for the project, all of the issues (problem reports) are associated with the [medley repo issue list](https://github.com/Interlisp/medley/issues). If you have a GitHub account, you can watch the repositories of interest (medley, maiko, online).

Bug reports, feature requests, documentation problems, and questions are posted as [GitHub issues in the Medley repository](https://github.com/Interlisp/medley/issues). Do check to see if your issue or question is answered there first.

* [Medley](https://github.com/Interlisp/medley): Lisp code, build scripts and GitHub automation
* [maiko](https://github.com/Interlisp/maiko): The C-coded virtual machine
* [this web site](https://github.com/Interlisp/Interlisp.github.io#README)

## 3. Join in the discussions

For email, there are two Google groups:

* [Interlisp](mailto:interlisp@googlegroups.com), archives [here](https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/interlisp), and
* [LispCore](mailto:lispcore@googlegroups.com), archives [here](https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/lispcore).

The archives are public. The LispCore group has access to meeting recordings, and usually gets more email (at least lately). Posts from non-members are moderated.

* Interlisp.org is a Google workspace; [let us know](mailto:info@interlisp.org) if you want an "interlisp.org" email addresses and why you want it.

* [Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat) has a #Interlisp IRC Channel. A place for informal chat. Connect by pointing your IRC client to `irc.libera.chat:6697` (TLS) and `/join #interlisp`. Say hello. There are also channels for #lisp (any dialect) and #common-lisp.
* [Lisp-Romania] has a Discord Interlisp channel.
* X (Twitter) handle: [interlisp8](https://twitter.com/interlisp8).

## 4. Weekly meetings. We have weekly meetings on Zoom:

Mondays:    2pm PT/5pm ET. Implementation -- technical discussions 
Wednesdays: 10am PT/1pm ET. Communication -- website, talks,
                             documentation, bibliography, etc.
	      
Meetings are to report accomplishments, status, plans, and problems, and discuss directions. Meetings are recorded, but recordings are not public.

## 6: Donations

We use donations to pay for online services, web hosting; larger donations for hiring consultants and contract workers to help with various tasks.
You can donate through GitHub sponsors, which is convenient. They do charge a fee -- 3% if done through ACH, 6% for credit card donations. For larger amounts contact [our donations team](mailto:board@interlisp.org).
