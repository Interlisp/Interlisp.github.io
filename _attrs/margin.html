For graphs, this sets x and y margins of canvas, in inches. If the margin
is a single double, both margins are set equal to the given value.
<P>
Note that the margin is not part of the drawing but just empty space
left around the drawing. It basically corresponds to a translation of
drawing, as would be necessary to center a drawing on a page. Nothing
is actually drawn in the margin. To actually extend the background of
a drawing, see the <A HREF=#d:pad>pad</A> attribute.
<P>
For clusters, this specifies the space between the nodes in the cluster and
the cluster bounding box. By default, this is 8 points.
<P>
For nodes, this attribute specifies space left around the node's label.
By default, the value is <TT>0.11,0.055</TT>.
