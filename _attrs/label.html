Text label attached to objects.
If a node's <A HREF=#d:shape>shape</A> is record, then the label can
have a <A HREF=shapes.html#record>special format</A>
which describes the record layout.
<P>
Note that a node's default label is "&#92;N", so the node's name or ID becomes
its label. Technically, a node's name can be an HTML string but this will not
mean that the node's label will be interpreted as an <a href="shapes.html#html">HTML-like label</a>. This is
because the node's actual label is an ordinary string, which will be replaced 
by the raw bytes stored in the node's name.
To get an HTML-like label, the label attribute value itself must be an HTML string.
