## What is Medley Interlisp?

Interlisp was a software development environment developed at Xerox PARC in the 1970s and 1980s to support research in Artificial Intelligence, computational linguistics, graphical user interfaces, hypertext, and other research areas. The 1992 ACM Software System Award was awarded to the Interlisp system for pioneering work in programming environments.

Interlisp as a system evolved from an interactive terminal style programming tool, to Interlisp-D as the GUI and entire operating system for the Xerox Lisp machines (called D-machines, named Dorado, Dolphin, Dandelion, Daybreak) with a common byte-coded virtual machine. The virtual machine was then ported to C for Sun Unix and many other Unix systems, and the system extended to support the Common Lisp standard intermixed.

Development of the system moved from Xerox PARC, to a Xerox AI Systems division, to a spin-out company called Envos, to a smaller company called Venue. The system was called Interlisp, Interlisp-D, and various named releases (Koto, Lyric, Medley) until the name "Medley" was used for the whole thing.

## What are we trying to accomplish?

Software development in Interlisp-D was a different experience than is common.
We hope to be able to not just demonstrate how it worked, but to revive the experimental development tools enough to support someone using it "in anger". To make the software usable, we need to overcome a number of compatibility problems with current C and operating systems, keyboard and display interfaces.

Interlisp users included researchers developing tools, demonstrations, and applications and we want to help revive, These include Rooms, Notecards, and LOOPS. 

## What have we done so far?

As with any software that evolved over a long time, there's been quite a bit of cleanup and retrofitting. Among other developments, you can now run Medley Interlisp on many OS and hardware configurations, or at https://online.interlisp.org in the cloud. See our [2021 Annual Report](news/2021AnnualReport), [Project News](/news/), and [recent release notes](https://github.com/Interlisp/medley/releases) . We've been working on integration of the Interlisp style development with `git` and `GitHub`, Docker and other 'modern' components.

## Who is involved?

The project includes some of the original developers and users as well as newcomers interested in software history and preservation. We work with [Partners](partners).

You can help! (See [Getting Involved](about/getInvolved/) for ways to get involved.

## Testimonials

-[What have we lost?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RNbIEJvjUA&t=841s)  A presentation from the 2020 Remote Chaos Experience conference highlights some of the interesting aspects of
-Interlisp.  The presentation synopsis states it this way:
-> We have ended up in a world where UNIX and Windows have taken over, and most people have never experienced anything else. Over the years, though, many other system designs have come and gone, and some of those systems have had neat ideas that were nevertheless not enough to achieve commercial success. We will take you on a tour of a variety of those systems, talking about what makes them special.
