This example illustrates the use of partially transparent colors for
node `fillcolor` and graph `bgcolor`.

Note the node `fillcolor` and graph `bgcolor` both have alpha/transparency
channels set.

The Graph's background is pure blue, but with some transparency, showing as blue tint
against this page's white background.

Nodes are greener where they overlap, and you can see some pink bleeding
through.
