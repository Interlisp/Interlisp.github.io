Set style information for components of the graph. For cluster subgraphs, if <TT>style="filled"</TT>, the
cluster box's background is filled.
<P>
If the default style attribute has been set for a component, an individual component can use
<TT>style=""</TT> to revert to the normal default. For example, if the graph has
<P>
<TT>edge [style="invis"]</TT>
<P>
making all edges invisible, a specific edge can overrride this via:
<P>
<TT>a -> b [style=""]</TT>
<P>
Of course, the component can also explicitly set its <TT>style</TT> attribute to the desired value.
