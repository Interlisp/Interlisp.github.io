When attached to the root graph, this color is used as the background for
entire canvas. When a cluster attribute, it is used as the initial
background for the cluster. If a cluster has a filled
<A HREF=#d:style>style</A>, the
cluster's <A HREF=#d:fillcolor>fillcolor</A> will overlay the
background color.
<P>
If the value is a <A HREF=#k:colorList>colorList</A>, a gradient fill is
used. By default, this is a linear fill; setting <TT>style=radial</TT> will
cause a radial fill. At present, only two colors are used. If the second
color (after a colon) is missing, the default color is used for it.
See also the <A HREF=#d:gradientangle>gradientangle</A> attribute
for setting the gradient angle. 
<P>
For certain output formats, such as PostScript, no fill is done for
the root graph unless
<b>bgcolor</b> is explicitly set. For bitmap formats, however, 
the bits need to be
initialized to something, so the canvas is filled with white by default.
This means that if the bitmap output is included in some other
document, all of the bits within the bitmap's bounding box will be
set, overwriting whatever color or graphics were already on the page.
If this effect is not desired, and you only want to set bits explicitly
assigned in drawing the graph, set <B>bgcolor</B>="transparent".
