Height of node, in inches. This is taken as the initial, minimum height
of the node. If <A HREF=#d:fixedsize><B>fixedsize</B></A> is true, this
will be the final height of the node. Otherwise, if the node label
requires more height to fit, the node's height will be increased to
contain the label. Note also that, if the output format is dot, the
value given to <B>height</B> will be the final value.
<P>
If the node shape is regular, the width and height are made identical.
In this case, if either the width or the height is set explicitly,
that value is used.
In this case, if both the width or the height are set explicitly,
the maximum of the two values is used.
If neither is set explicitly, the minimum of the two default values
is used.
