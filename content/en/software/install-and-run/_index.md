Medley and the Lisp software it's built on are the same for any computer it runs on. What's different is Maiko, the virtual machine emulator that hosts Lisp on a given computer system. Maiko is written in C so you can to run Medley on many different OS or machine architecture like BSD or Android.

See the [Maiko README](https://github.com/Interlisp/maiko) and [Medley README](https://github.com/Interlisp/medley) in their respective GitHub repository pages for more details on how to build and run them.
