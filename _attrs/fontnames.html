Allows user control of how basic fontnames are represented in SVG output.
If <TT>fontnames</TT> is undefined or <TT>"svg"</TT>,
the output will try to use known SVG fontnames. For example, the
default font  <TT>"Times-Roman"</TT> will be mapped to the
basic SVG font <TT>"serif"</TT>. This can be overridden by setting
<TT>fontnames</TT> to  <TT>"ps"</TT> or  <TT>"gd"</TT>.
In the former case, known PostScript font names such as
<TT>"Times-Roman"</TT> will be used in the output.
In the latter case, the fontconfig font conventions
are used. Thus, <TT>"Times-Roman"</TT> would be treated as
<TT>"Nimbus Roman No9 L"</TT>. These last two options are useful
with SVG viewers that support these richer fontname spaces.
