Specifies strictness of level constraints in neato
when <TT><A HREF=#d:mode>mode</A>="ipsep" or "hier"</TT>.
Larger positive values mean stricter constraints, which demand more
separation between levels. On the other hand, negative values will relax
the constraints by allowing some overlap between the levels.
