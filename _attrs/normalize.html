If set, normalize coordinates of final
layout so that the first point is at the origin, and then rotate the
layout so that the angle of the first edge is specified by the value of <TT>normalize</TT> in degrees.
If  <TT>normalize</TT> is not a number, it is evaluated as a  <TT>bool</TT>, with true
corresponding to 0 degrees. <B>NOTE:</B> Since the attribute is evaluated first as a number,
0 and 1 cannot be used for false and true.
