If the edge has a <A HREF=#d:URL>URL</A> or <A HREF=#d:labelURL>labelURL</A>
attribute, this attribute determines which window of the
browser is used
for the URL attached to the label.
Setting it to "_graphviz" will open a new window if it
doesn't already exist, or reuse it if it does.
If undefined, the value of the <A HREF=#d:target>target</A> is used.
