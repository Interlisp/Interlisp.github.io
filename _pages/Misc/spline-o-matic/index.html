<i> Spline-o-matic </i> is an edge router that
draws Bezier curves in diagrams. It comes with a
TCL/tk interface for tests and demos.
<p>
The library accepts as input:
<p>
<ul>
<li> two endpoints
<li> optional endpoint tangent vectors
<li> an admissable region where a curve may be
drawn to connect the endpoints
</ul>
<p>
It returns a Bezier curve that connects the endpoints 
and stays within the admissable region.  The curve is
smooth and close to a shortest path.  
<P> 

<H3>Spline-o-matic Solves Two Types of Problems</H3>
In the first case, the input is a simple polygon,
with the two endpoints must be inside it.
The result curve stays within the control polygon.
<p>
In the second case, the input is a list of polygonal
obstacles or ``holes'' to be avoided, along with the
endpoints.  The result curve does not pass through
any obstacle .  (If an endpoint is inside an obstacle,
it is ignored for the given route.  This is convenient
for routing node-link diagrams.)
<p>
Curves are routed individually, not globally, so the
edge router does not prevent them from crossing.
An interesting improvement to this library would be
introduce some notion of global planning to prevent
unwanted edge crossings.
The library interface to Spline-o-matic exposes its
main algorithms so they may be invoked independently
for efficiency and flexibility.
<p>
Curves are computed in two phases.  The first phase finds
a shortest path (a polyline) between endpoints.  As described
previously, there are two variants. Routing inside a polygon is
solved by an efficient algorithm due to Overmars and Welzl,
but routing around obstacles involves computing the visibility
graph of the obstacles' vertices, for which we employ the
standard O(N^3) algorithm.  When more than one edge route is to
be found, it is much faster to precompute and re-use the
visibility graph, than to compute it for each route.
<p>
The second phase takes an arbitrary simple path (usually a shortest
path computed by the first phase) and a list of barrier segments
(usually sides of a control polygon or of obstacles) and produces
a Bezier curve that does not touch a barrier except on an endpoint.
Note that the barriers are not required to form polygons.
<p>
Here is the library API.  Polygons must always be presented
in clockwise order!

<h2>Distribution</h2>
The source release is on our <A HREF="Download.html">download page</A>.
Considerable software know-how is needed to work with it.
The GUI is written in TCL.  The path planner is built as a static library. 
The TCL layer includes this and other functions as a dynamic library.
<h2>GUI</h2>
The package has a C library interface and a TCL/tk GUI (contributed
by John Ellson, ellson@research.att.com) for demos and debugging.
Run pathtest.tcl (or tclsh pathtest.tcl).  The GUI permits drawing
obstacle polygons (use button 1 to place vertices and button 2 to
place the last vertex of a polygon).
<p>
pathtest comes with a few
sample obstacle configurations.
To try it, run pathtest.tcl.
load an example, click on the Bezier radio button,
and use mouse button 1 and 2 to sweep a line segment.
A curve will be routed between its endpoints.
The choice of routing inside a polygon or routing around
obstacles depends on the endpoints.
