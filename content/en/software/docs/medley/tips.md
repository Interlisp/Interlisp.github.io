## Get an Interlisp Exec (REPL)

Click and hold the right mouse button on the background, hover over EXEC, move to the right, go to "Interlisp", release the right mouse button.

## Increase the font size

In an Interlisp Exec, type one of the following:

```
(FONTSET 'BIGGER)
(FONTSET 'HUGE)
```

**New** windows and future lines in the Exec will now be in a larger font.

## Edit a function definition

To edit the definition of a function FOO, type into an Interlisp Exec:

```
(DF FOO)
```

This will let you draw out a new SEdit window, which you can use to edit the code.

Middle-click in the titlebar to get additional options.
