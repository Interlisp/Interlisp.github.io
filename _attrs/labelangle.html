This, along with <A HREF=#d:labeldistance>labeldistance</A>, determine
where the
headlabel (taillabel) are placed with respect to the head (tail)
in polar coordinates. The origin in the coordinate system is
the point where the edge touches the node. The ray of 0 degrees
goes from the origin back along the edge, parallel to the edge
at the origin.
<P>
The angle, in degrees, specifies the rotation from the 0 degree ray,
with positive angles moving counterclockwise and negative angles
moving clockwise.
