Packaged releases of Medley are available for Linux (most recent distros), MacOS and Windows 10/11.  Both x86_64 and Arm64 systems are supported (as well as Arm7 - e.g., Raspberry Pi - for Linux).  Instructions for installing and running Medley on these platforms can be found:

* [Mac OS](macos)
* [WIndows](windows)
* [Linux](linux)

Medley is capable of running on a variety of other OSes including FreeBSD and Solaris as well as on other CPU architectures including i386, SPARC, PowerPC, and Risc-V.  To install and run Medley on these platforms, you will need to build Maiko (the underlying virtual machine for Medley) from the sources available in the Interlisp/maiko repository on github.com.  Instructions for building Maiko can be be found in the [*README* for Maiko](https://github.com/interlisp/maiko#readme). 

To make new Medley sysouts or build your own applications, see the [Building instructions and explanations](https://github.com/Interlisp/medley/blob/master/BUILDING.md).
