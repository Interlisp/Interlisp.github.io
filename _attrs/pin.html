If true and the node has a pos attribute on input, neato or fdp prevents the
node from moving from the input position. This property can also be specified
in the pos attribute itself (cf. the <A HREF=#k:point>point</A> type).
<P>
<B>Note:</B> Due to an artifact of the implementation, 
previous to 27 Feb 2014, final coordinates
are translated to the origin. Thus, if you look at the output coordinates
given in the (x)dot or plain format, pinned nodes will not have the same
output coordinates as were given on input. If this is important, a
simple workaround is to maintain the coordinates of a pinned node. The vector
difference between the old and new coordinates will give the translation,
which can then be subtracted from all of the appropriate coordinates.
<P>
After 27 Feb 2014, this translation can be avoided in neato by setting the 
<A HREF="#d:notranslate">notranslate</A> to TRUE. However, if the graph
specifies <A HREF="#d:overlap">node overlap removal</A> or a change in 
<A HREF="#d:ratio">aspect ratio</A>, node coordinates may still change.
